Q    Mr. President, what would you like to say to European partners?  What would you like to say to European partners?
MR. PRESIDENT:  I’m going to say that to their face.  I’m going to say — all I have to say, I’m going to say when I get there.
But I’ll be happy to talk to you guys when I get back or —  how many — are you coming?
Q    They’re there.  They’re there.
Q    (Inaudible.)
MR. PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  I know.
Q    Mr. President, how concerned — how concerned are you about the threat of chemical warfare right now, that Russia will use chemical weapons?  How high is that threat?
MR. PRESIDENT:  I think it’s a real threat.
Thank you.  Thanks.
