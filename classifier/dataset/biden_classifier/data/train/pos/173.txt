Oval Office
11:12 A.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m happy to have the House and Senate leadership here.  You can see Senator McConnell and Leader McCarthy and Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Schumer.  And what we’re going to talk about today is — you know, when I ran, I said wasn’t going to be a Democratic President; I was going to be a President for all Americans. And what the bottom line here is: We’re going to see whether we can reach some consensus on a compromise on moving forward.  And we’re going to talk a lot about infrastructure today to see if there’s any way we can reach a compromise that gets the people’s work done and is within the bounds of everyone agreeing.  And that’s the purpose of this meeting. Not much more to say right now, but we’ll — we’re going to get — we’re going to get going.  That’s it. Q    How do you expect to do that, sir?  How do you expect to come to a compromise? THE PRESIDENT:  Easy.  Just snap my fingers.  It’ll happen.  (Laughter.) Thank you. 11:13 A.M.
