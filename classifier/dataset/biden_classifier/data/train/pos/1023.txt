1:07 P.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Jill and I are — thank you for joining us today.  And we’re — we have a special guest, as you can see to my left here.And I’m thankful to our friends at the White House Historical Association and the National Park Service for helping us deliver thousands of commemorative eggs to vaccination sites in communities and healthcare centers all across America.Easter is a day of joy, when we celebrate resurrection and renewal.  But this year, we know many are still going without the familiar comforts of the season. The virus is not gone, and the second year in a row most will be apart from their families or friends and a full congregation to fill us with so much joy.  But the Scripture tells us, “Joy cometh in the morning.”As we celebrate the renewal of this season, we know that longed-for dawn is almost here.  We will rebuild our nation.  We will reengage and reimagine what we can be.  We’ll remember that with faith, hope, and love, anything is possible.  And we look forward to next year when the White House will ring with joy the season once again and there’ll be an Easter Egg Roll, God willing.May God bless you all.  May God protect our troops — and take care of the Easter Bunny.  (Laughter.)Thank you all very, very much. 1:09 P.M.
