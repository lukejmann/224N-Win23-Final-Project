Q    Will you reach a deal on the package before you leave for the G20? THE PRESIDENT:  You all never believed from the beginning I’d ever get anything done.  I think we’ll get a deal. Q    Are you accepting losing — going from 12 years [sic] to 4 years [sic] of paid family leave? THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not going to get into — like I wouldn’t be — if I negotiated with you guys all along, I wouldn’t be as far along as I am.  I’m hopeful.  I think we’ll get a good deal. Q    Are you concerned about Chinese hypersonic missiles? THE PRESIDENT:  Yes. END
