THE PRESIDENT:  We answered enough questions today.  The only reason I’m stopping: I feel badly you’re here this hour of the night. Q    Mr. President, can you clarify what you said about no — that there’s no — no one in the Democratic Party is anti-police? THE PRESIDENT:  I didn’t say that. Q    I know that you said you don’t want to defund the police — THE PRESIDENT:  I said that that — that is not the Democratic Party’s position.  Q    Okay. THE PRESIDENT:  I’m the Democratic Party; I am President.  So is the Speaker of the House and so is the –- the Majority Leader.  We are not the defunding the police. Q    Okay.  And are there people who — in the Democratic Party, who want to defund the police? THE PRESIDENT:  Are there people in the Republican Party who think we’re sucking the blood out of kids? END
