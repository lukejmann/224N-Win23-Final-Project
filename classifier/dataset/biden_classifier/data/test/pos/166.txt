3:27 P.M. CST Q  Mr. President, should congressional Democrats move on to working on voting rights legislation this year and put off your Build Back Better plan until 2022? THE PRESIDENT:  If we can get the congressional voting rights done, we should do it.  If we can’t, we got to keep going.  There’s nothing domestically more important than voting rights.  It’s the single-biggest issue. 3:27 P.M.
