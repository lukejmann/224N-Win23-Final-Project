THE PRESIDENT:  Don’t forget to vote.
Q    How are you feeling about tomorrow, sir?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m feeling — I’m optimistic.  But I’m always optimistic.
Q    Can Democrats win the House?
THE PRESIDENT:  I think it’s going to be tough, but I think we can.  I think we’ll win the Senate, and I think the House is tougher.
Q    What do you think awaits you if it is a Republican-controlled Congress?
THE PRESIDENT:  What do I think what?
Q    Awaits you.  What’s — what’s your new reality going to be like in Washington?
THE PRESIDENT:  More difficult.
