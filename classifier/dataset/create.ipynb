PRESIDENT:  Well, hello, Arizona!  (Applause.)  It is great to be here.  What an inspiring place.  How about a big round of applause for the guys in the big trucks behind me.  What a tremendous — what a great job.\\nTo Governor Doug Ducey, to Senator Martha McSally, to Jim Umpleby —\\nPARTICIPANT:  (Inaudible.)\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  — who is a fellow Hoosier who actually went to college at a rival college — (laughter) — across the Hoosier State.  And most especially to the men and women of this great company.  Caterpillar is a legendary American company and its best days are ahead here in the Grand Canyon State and all across America.  Thanks for what you do.  (Applause.)  What a great team.\\nAnd before I get started, let me also say what an honor it is to be here today with a man you just heard from, a man I just mentioned, and, frankly, someone who I hope you know is simply one of the best governors in the United States of America.  I can honestly say I was for Doug Ducey before it was cool.  (Laughter.)\\nWould you join me?  Why don’t you all get on your feet and thank Governor Doug Ducey for all that he’s done for Arizona, for jobs and schools, and for quality of life?  Thank you, Governor.  (Applause.)  What a great guy.\\nIt’s also a privilege to be here today with a great American leader — a woman who has dedicated her life to making this country better and more prosperous.  And now she serves in this administration as the Treasurer of the United States of America.  Jovita Carranza, thank you for your service to America and your stalwart support of the USMCA.  (Applause.)\\nAnd finally, I know I’m going to say a little bit more about her in a little bit, but I have to tell you: My son is actually a fighter pilot in the Marine Corps.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  And so I’m a little partial to fighter pilots.  (Laughter.)  And I’ll tell you what — if you haven’t figured it out yet, Arizona — she served in the House of Representatives for you, and now she’s emerged already as one of the great leaders in the United States Senate.  Arizona has a fighter in Senator Martha McSally, and we are so grateful for your strong leadership on this issue.  (Applause.)   Thank you, Martha.\\nAnd finally, let me bring greetings from a friend of mine who loves that state of Arizona — always be grateful for the support the people of Arizona have afforded us in that election in 2016.  He is a great champion of American manufacturing.  And he’s been working hard to bring manufacturing back since the day we took office.  I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.  (Applause.)\\nAnd I’m here on this breezy and cool day in Arizona — (laughter) — here in “football weather” — is that right? — just to speak to you on the President’s behalf, and really on behalf of the nation, to say we’ve got an incredible opportunity before us, Arizona.  As I stand before you today, Congress has on their desk the largest trade deal in American history.  And I came here to Tucson, I came to Arizona to say the time has come for Congress to pass the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and pass it this year.   (Applause.)\\nWe’re going to talk about trade today — which Caterpillar is a global company, isn’t it?  Selling your products literally all over the world.  American excellence in high relief.  We’re going to talk about Arizona workers and Arizona businesses.\\nBut before that, let me reflect on the progress we’ve made because of the confidence the people of Arizona placed in this President and our administration two and a half years ago.  I think there’s only one way you can describe the last two and a half years: It’s been two and a half years of action, two and a half years of results.  It’s been two and a half years of promises made and promises kept.  But we’re just getting started, Arizona.  That’s why we need the USMCA.  (Applause.)\\nYou know, at a time when so many in Congress have spent the last two and a half years on endless investigations, trying to overturn the will of the American people in that last election, I’m glad to report to you today, as you’ve already heard from this podium, that there is bipartisan support for the USMCA.  But we need Speaker Pelosi to put the USMCA on the floor of the House of Representatives, and do it this year.  (Applause.)\\nThe good news is that, even just yesterday, Speaker Pelosi said that House Democrats were, in her words, on a path to “yes.”  And we want them to keep going on that path.  Let’s get to “yes” on the USMCA and score a victory for jobs in Arizona and America.  Okay?  (Applause.)\\nI mean, I think you all know the American people don’t want more partisanship; we want more jobs.  Right?  We don’t want more resistance; we want more results.  The American people want the USMCA to pass and to pass this year.  And I literally have been traveling all over the country — all over the country, Jim — telling this story.\\nAnd everywhere I go I hear the tremendous support for the USMCA.  And I’ll make you a promise: Whatever goes on in Washington, D.C., this President, this Vice President, your senator, your governor will not be deterred.  We’re going to keep fighting for jobs.  We’re going to get the USMCA on the floor of the Congress.  (Applause.)  And we’re going to fight until we get it done.\\nYou know, we’ve been fighting to keep the promises that President Trump made to the people of Arizona since day one.  I mean, this President promised to rebuild our military, and I’m proud to report that this President has already signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan.  He also promised — (applause) — thank you.\\nHe also promised to revive this economy.  And we cut taxes for working families and businesses.  We rolled back red tape.  We’ve unleashed American energy and unleashed an American energy revolution.  And we’ve negotiated free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first.\\nAnd I don’t need to tell you here in Arizona, which is a booming state, that the results have been remarkable.  Since Election Day 2016, businesses large and small across this country have created 6.3 million new jobs, including 200,000 good-paying jobs right here in the Grand Canyon State.  How about that?  (Applause.)  That’s great, Governor.\\nUnemployment has hit a 50-year low.  And I’m proud to report — as we just began Hispanic Heritage Month all across this country, and I met with great leaders in the Hispanic American community before we left Phoenix this morning — we now have the lowest unemployment ever recorded for Hispanic Americans and African Americans.  The American Dream is working again for every American.  (Applause.)\\nI mean, it is — it really is amazing.  And you need look no farther, Jim, than manufacturing to find proof of what’s happening in this economy.  Today, there are more manufacturing job openings in America than any time in the last decade.  In fact, there’s more job openings in manufacturing and across this country today than there are people looking for work.  And last year, we saw a record-high optimism among manufacturers and small businesses, and the most new manufacturing jobs created in more than 20 years.  Now, that’s real different from about three years ago.\\nI remember the last President was talking about manufacturing jobs were gone for good.  And I’ve got to tell you: You know, I’m proud of that Caterpillar operation back in Indiana — just as proud as you are here in Arizona, Governor.  And you know, in Arizona, kind of like Indiana, we do two things well; you know, you make things and you grow things.\\nAnd we had a President in the last administration who said, “What are you going to?  Are you going to wave a magic wand to get those jobs back?”  They’d actually lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs.  Well, we didn’t need a magic wand, we just needed President Donald Trump in the White House.  (Applause.)  Five hundred thousand manufacturing jobs created all across America, including nineteen thousand jobs right here in Arizona.\\nIt’s not just been about more jobs.  It’s also been about better jobs.  I mean, since our Election Day in 2016, I’m proud to report the average American household has seen their income go up by more the $5,000 a year.  Wages are rising at the fastest pace in a decade.\\nAnd what’s most exciting to the President and me — while we’d like to see everybody’s income rising, the truth is wages are rising most rapidly for blue-collar, hardworking Americans.  The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more.  (Applause.)  It’s true.\\nI mean, we’re seeing success stories all across the country over the last two and a half years.  And for more than 90 years, Caterpillar has been one of America’s best companies.  And, Jim, you and your team are keeping that proud tradition alive.  I’m told Caterpillar — your machines are sold on six continents.  And the United States military is even using them on the seventh continent: Antarctica.  (Laughter.)  And I hope they don’t drive across any thin ice.  (Laughter.)\\nCaterpillar’s success story is a — is really a part of the success of this country.  I mean, think about it:  Caterpillar’s machines were used by the Allies during World War Two.  They worked on some of the most iconic projects in American history, like the Golden Gate Bridge, the Hoover Dam, and widening the Panama Canal.  Caterpillar was there.\\nIn an extraordinary legacy, you continue today with these new developments and innovations like we just saw with these trucks all behind us.  It really was amazing.  Jim had to point out to me which of the trucks had drivers and which ones didn’t.  And, Jim, I’m actually just kind of glad you didn’t make me stand down there as they were rolling around before you told me that.  But they did an incredible job.\\nAnd with this booming economy, I’m also told Caterpillar sales have soared by 42 percent since 2016, and you created 3,000 jobs right here in the United States of America.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Caterpillar.\\nBut I think Jim would be the first one to say results like that just don’t happen.  Sure, they’re a result of economic policies that allow companies like this one to keep more of what they earn and reinvest and be free of burdensome regulations.  Sure, that — there’s some credit that goes to opening up markets around the world to what you build here and what you make here.\\nBut I know Jim would be the first to say it’s — it’s really about all of you.  And all of you, each and every day, practice the integrity, the craftsmanship, the hard work, and the ingenuity that makes these incredible machines become a reality.\\nI mean, the truth is, Caterpillar is prospering, Arizona and America are prospering because of people just like you.  So give yourselves a round of applause.  Great job.  (Applause.)\\nAnd there’s all kinds of individual stories.  I’m told there’s another Marine here, who actually was a veteran of the Illinois National Guard.  He served this nation as an anti-aircraft missile launcher technician and now he uses his technical skills gained in the uniform to help customers use Cat’s technology on mining projects all over the world.  He’s been with Caterpillar for 15 years.\\nSo, for all he did in the uniform in the United States, and all he’s done to make this company such a great success, would you join me in thanking Justin Sanchez — Justin Sanchez.  Where are you, Sarge?  Stand up.  There you are.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Sergeant.\\nI’m told there’s another veteran of the Air Force.  Martha, you’ll be glad to know — another veteran the Air Force.  Also, the Washington Air National Guard, specialized in avionic electronics and repairing preparing radars on A-10s —\\nPARTICIPANT:  (Inaudible.)\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Very good — C-130s, K-135s.\\nAnd now she tells the story of Caterpillar’s Surface Mining technology to employees around the world.  So would you join me in thanking her for her service in uniform and her service here?  Where’s Amy Madsen?  Staff Sergeant Amy Madsen, take a bow.  (Applause.)  Great job.  Amy’s got a fan club.  (Laughter.)  That’s great.\\nAnd, you know, I recognized the two of them because, frankly, they’re emblematic of all of you.  In fact, in that aspect of their background, they’re like a whole lot of you gathered here today.  I’m told they’re not the only ones at Caterpillar who’ve worn the uniform of the United States.\\nSo, how about if you’re a veteran, if you’re able to stand — if you wore the uniform of the United States, would you just mind standing up, letting us show how much we appreciate all you’ve done for our country. Let’s thank our veterans.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks for your service, all.\\nAnd thank you all.  Congratulations.  I mean, the remarkable employees here today — like Justin and Amy, and like all of you — show that American workers can compete with anybody, anywhere in the world.\\nAnd we’re doing it now today, but the truth is, we can do it even better if we open more markets around the world to what we make, what we manufacture, and what we export from here.  And the good news is the President’s been working on opening up markets around the world since day one.  We renegotiated a trade agreement with South Korea.  We signed the first phase of a new bilateral trade agreement with Japan.  And President Trump put China on notice that the era of economic surrender is over.  We’re going to defend American jobs and American workers.  (Applause.)\\nBut closer to home, it brings us to the USMCA.  And I won’t belabor the point; you all know my opinion on it, right?  I mean, the truth is this is a historic agreement.  And it’s an agreement that — it’s a win for every American.  The truth is, according to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA, once it’s signed into law, is going to add about $68 billion to our economy.  And right out of the gate, we think it’s going to create 176,000 American jobs, including nearly 50,000 manufacturing jobs.  And that’s a conservative estimate.\\nAnd we’re not just creating more jobs, but better jobs.  The ITC also says that when this trade agreement is passed, American manufacturing workers are going to get another raise, in addition to the wages that are rising already.  American manufacturing is working today.  American manufacturing is going to win even more when we pass the USMCA.  (Applause.)\\nSo I want to encourage each and every one of you.  I want to encourage each and every one of you to let your voice be heard.  You know, I served in the Congress of the United States for 12 years before I became Governor of the state of Indiana, and I know that the most powerful voice — the most powerful force, rather — in Washington, D.C., is not one party or another, not some special interest or another, it’s not even the media.  The most powerful force in Washington, D.C., is the voice of the American people.  So, Arizona, let your voice be heard.  (Applause.)\\nThis is a time for you to pick up the phone, send an e-mail, tweet, reach out to those who represent Arizona in our nation’s capital.  But I could save you — I can save you some money.  First and foremost, you don’t need to call Senator Kyrsten Sinema, because she’s been out there standing for the USMCA early on.  And you sure don’t need to call Senator Martha McSally.  She is leading the charge in the United States Senate for the USMCA.  (Applause.)\\nBut I have to tell you, it’s time — it’s time to reach out.  It’s time to reach out to the rest of the delegation.  Martha was talking about the folks that represent you in Washington, D.C.  And it’s time for you to reach out and make a respectful phone call, and tell people,  You know, I was standing on a hillside outside Tucso- — Tucson and ran into Mike Pence” — (laughter) — “and a whole bunch of big trucks.  And he just told me that this USMCA would be a huge win, not just for the company that I work for, but really for Arizona, and for — and for everybody across this country.”  And just tell them that, you know, the time has come for Congress to set politics aside. The time has come for Congress to vote on the USMCA.  Just call them up and tell them that.  (Applause.)\\nAnd you can start right here in Tucson.  You can start right here in Tucson.  Give Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick a call.  Tell her I told you to call.  And tell her you need the USMCA.  And tell her to go tell Speaker Pelosi that when the USMCA comes to the floor, she’s going to cast a vote for Arizona and she’s going to cast a vote for jobs.\\nI mean, the truth of matter is that, if all of us will do all we can to send a clear message to our nation’s capital, we’re going to get this done.  We’re going to roll our sleeves up.  Even in these divided times in Washington, D.C., we have an opportunity, men and women, to do something that will be good for every American.  It’ll be something every American, whatever their politics, can rally behind.  So, let your voice be heard and we’ll get the USMCA done.  I promise you, Arizona.  (Applause.)\\nSo, thanks for coming out today.  I appreciate it.  I actually skipped through some of my speech because I figured you’d appreciate it too.  (Laughter.)\\nBut it really is an honor to be with you.  I have to tell you, for a small town guy from southern Indiana to be here in Arizona and serving as your Vice President is the greatest honor of my life.  So, can I just take this opportunity to say to the people of Arizona: Thank you for the opportunity of serving as your Vice President.  (Applause.)\\nI’m grateful on behalf of myself and my family and — I already told the governor, that son of mine is going to be moving to Arizona before too long.  So — (laughter) — you’re going to have a Pence not too far from here, and we’re going to be proud.  We’ll be proud to fly in as quietly as we possibly can, Governor — to visit my son and wonderful daughter-in-law.\\nBut I want to thank you for what you’ve done here.  This is an incredible company.  Jim, congratulations again on all your incredible success.  Governor, thank you for leading the state with such energy and conviction and such good-natured winsomeness that you have that’s all about you.  Thank you, Senator McSally for your — for your being a champion for all the people.  And thank all of you.  And thank you, Arizona, for the support that you provided to us and continue to support.\\nAnd I promise you — I promise you not just on the USMCA — on behalf of President Donald Trump and I, we’re never going to stop fighting for everything the people of Arizona sent us to Washington to do.  We’re going to make this nation more prosperous than ever before.  We’re going to make this nation safer than ever before.  And I know, with your continued support and with the great example of the people of this company, and with God’s help, we’re going to keep America great.\\nThanks, everybody.  God bless you.  God bless Arizona.  And God bless America.  (Applause.)\\nEND   \n",
      "1     \\nGrand Hall, Green River CollegeAuburn, Washington\\n1:19 P.M. PDT  THE PRESIDENT:  Juliana, my colleagues — I’m taking her back to Washington.  We’re going to get my — the rest of my bill passed.  (Laughter.)  We’re going to get it done.\\nMS. JULIANA GRACEFFO:  Yes, we are.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  By the way, I hope I don’t embarrass her, but she’s off to Notre Dame next year.  (Applause.)  I’ve done the commencement there a couple times.  I told her if she sees me on campus, I don’t want her say “Joe who?” when I come up to see her.  (Laughter.)  Promise?\\nMS. JULIANA GRACEFFO:  Promise.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  God love you.  Thank you very, very much.  (Applause.)\\nMS. JULIANA GRACEFFO:  Thank you so much (inaudible).\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mom.\\nElisa and Juliana, thank you for that introduction.  And, you know, as my mother would say, “God love you.”  You’re saving lives.  You’re saving lives by pointing out what needs to be done.\\nYou know, the — I want to start off, though, by pointing out a couple things.  Number one, as was mentioned earlier, my wife Jill is a community college professor.  I believe she’s the only — (applause) — she’s the only First Lady ever to work full-time.  And she’s still working full-time as a community college professor.  And that’s not why — that’s why she’s not with me today.\\nBut one of the things we’re also working on, just parenthetically — and this is a great — this is a great college.  It really is.  (Applause.)  Thanks in part to the leadership of the Governor, you have one of the best systems in the country.\\nAnd I want you to know, though, that we know and I know firsthand — my wife is an English professor and teaches writing as well — the number of students who come back to schools like this and the community college where Jill teaches, Northern Virginia Community College, are coming back having not been in school for a long time, many times.\\nThey’re coming back because they want to better their lives, breaking their necks to get here.  Some of them — and they’re — the average age of my wife’s students is 28 years of age.  That’s the average age.  People coming back from — coming through difficult circumstances they find themselves in.  And back east, a number of immigrant families coming through.\\nAnd the cost is still — no matter how the states try to control it, it still matters.\\nSo, one of the things that — it didn’t do all I wanted to do, but I was just able to sign the new budget bill that increases the Pell Grants by $400 a year.  (Applause.)  The largest increase in 10 years.  But we have to do more.\\nLook, I want to say a special thank you to Governor Inslee for his welcome and his partnership across a broad range of issues.  I — including strengthening the pen- — the economy, your economy, and fighting the pandemic.\\nBut, you know, I refer to him, and I — he knows this to be true because when I was back seeking the nomination, he is the “Environmental Governor” of the nation.  This guy is leading the whole country.  (Applause.)\\nAnd you have one heck of a congressional delegation, starting — (applause) — starting with my friend, Patty Murray.  You know, when we passed the Recovery Act — the first bill we passed — I went to Patty and I said, “I want to deal with the Child Tax Credit,” which was something that had to be done.  Patty has been fighting for it for years and years and years.  I got it passed.  We got it passed.  And it reduced child poverty in America by 40 percent.  But because of a couple folks — because we don’t have this — (applause) — we lack 1 Democrat and 50 Republicans from — keeping it from passing this time around.\\nBut it really fundamentally changed the lives of millions of people, Patty.  You know it better than I do.  But it reduced child poverty by 40 percent.\\nAnd she talked about — earlier about — about the cost of childcare.  I was a single dad for five years when my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident.  And everybody — and I commuted every day — did 250 miles, 270 miles a day from Wilmington, Delaware, to Washington, D.C., on Amtrak.\\nEverybody thought I did it because I just wanted to be home.  And that’s true.  But I did it because I couldn’t possibly afford childcare.  I was a United States senator.  I had the dubious distinction for 36 years of being listed as the poorest man in the Senate.  (Laughter.)  But I was making a lot of money as a senator, from my perspective, and I didn’t think I should be making any money other than my salary as a senator.\\nAnd I could not possibly afford — even back in 1972 and ‘3, I could not afford childcare.  That’s why I went home every single night, over a million two hundred million miles — -two hundred thousand miles worth over my career.\\nAnd, folks, we got — we — there’s easy answers.  There’s easy answers.  We can do all that Patty and I and others have been talking about, and not one person in America making less than $400,000 a year will see a single, solitary increase in their taxes.  Not one.  Not a single increase.\\nAnd, folks, you know, I’m — you know, I’ve sometimes been called by some of my interesting Republican friends — we’re all — “Democrats are all socialists.”  I’m a capitalist.  And I think if you can make a billion dollars or a million dollars or a hundred million, you should be able to do it.  But pay your fair share.  (Applause.)  Pay your fair share.\\nI come from the corporate state of the world, Delaware.  More corporations are incorporated in Delaware than every other state in the Union combined.  And I got elected six times as senator notwithstanding that.\\nHere’s the point: Of the Fortune 500 companies, 40 of them last year, they made $40 billion and didn’t pay a single, solitary penny in taxes.  It’s not right.  It’s just not fair.  All you got to do is just pay a fair share.  And we can do all of this and so much more, but that’s not what — my point of being here tonight — or today, I should say.\\nAnd Senator Cantwell, she’s been a champion in this state, a key player in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and delivering high-speed Internet all across the state of Washington.  And — because we’re going to outcompete the rest of the world.  She understands how we do it.  We got to have you have access — access to that information.\\nThink about it: During the pandemic, how many of your — you parents had to drive your kids into a McDonald’s parking lot to get on the Internet to be able to do your homework?  Not a joke.  This the United States of America, for God’s sake.  The United States of America.  Because of this lady and others, we are going to see to it every single place in this country — rural, urban, and suburban — has access to high-speed Internet.\\n(Applause.)\\nAnd Congressman Schrier, who represents the district — a doctor, an MD, who knows what folks go through in our healthcare system and knows how to make it better.  You know, this includes how to fill the nursing shortage to help colleges like this one train and prepare the next generation of nurses and healthcare workers.\\nMy wife and her at — when at Delaware Community College and now Northern Virginia, teaches an awful lot of nurses — an awful lot of nurses.  And, by the way, docs are okay.  (Laughter.)  I’ve been a significant consumer of healthcare in my career, unfortunately.  I was hospitalized for the better part of seven months with two cranial aneurysms and an embolism, and my son Beau was — came back as a decorated war hero from the state — from Iraq after a year with stage four glioblastoma and spent 15 months at the end just hanging on.\\nAnd, you know, doctors let you live.  Nurses, male and female — I’m not joking — any of you in nursing programs — they make you want to live.  Not a joke.  Not a joke.  (Applause.)\\nAnd I think it’s the single-most underrated profession in the United States of America.  I really mean it.  When I was at Walter Reed all those months, I’d lay there in that ICU and look at the — at the monitors.  And you know if any of those lines go flat, you’re in trouble.  (Laughter.)\\nBut seriously, after a while — and you’ve seen this, Doc — you just get tired.  Wasn’t in pain; just get tired.  You just want to stop.\\nAnd my nurses — I remember to this day their names — they’d come in and they’d change the pillow, they’d rub my head, they’d do something — they’d keep you moving, talk to you.  Talk to you.\\nThat’s why, what I did was — they — everybody who comes out of an intensive care unit, the joke is — in hospitals — is they either get taken out in a — the nurses never see them again.  They either get taken out in a bag and — or they never want to come back.  (Laughter.)  I used to go back once a month and have dinner for the nurses every night — on the nightshift, to thank them.\\nSo any of you who are — anybody in — well, I’m not sure how many are part of the college, but any of you studying nursing, keep it —\\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  Nurses are over here!  (Applause.)\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, God love them.  No, I really mean it.  And I don’t want to disappoint you, but the male nurses are as consequential as the female nurses.  Okay?  (Laughter.)  Not a joke.\\nAnd so, anyway, I just wanted to mention that.  And I want to thank Congresswoman [Congressman] Kilmer and — for the nearby district — the 6th District, I guess.  He’s leading the charge in the economy to make sure that — that we leave no community behind.\\nAnd we’re also joined today by Larsen and — and — (laughs) — I know it.  You got —\\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  Smith.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I got it.  (Laughter.)  DelBene, who’s a real champion for working families.  And while she couldn’t be here today, Congresswoman Jayapal is doing an incredible job in the state.  (Applause.)  She’s visiting — she’s been a great partner of mine and worked really closely with me.  And she’s visiting her — her family now, and she’ll be back shortly.\\nBut, folks, we’re all laser-focused on lowering the costs for you and your families across the board.  And a big way to do that is lower the cost of healthcare — healthcare especially in the area of prescription drugs.\\nThe governor of this state has already gotten insulin down to 35 bucks for — I guess it’s a year you’ve done it so far.  Is that right?\\nWell, either — earlier this month, President Obama came back to the White House.  He’s a good friend.  He came back to the White House for the first time in a long time to celebrate the 12th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act.\\nAnd we talked about how hard it was to get it done in the first place and why we were so determined to get it done.  It was for the people who desperately needed it and had no alternatives and deserve to be treated with, as my dad — the word — word he used most is: Everyone is entitled to be treated with “dignity.”  Everyone.  And there’s no loss of your dignity like not being able to take care of a child who’s sick or a wife or a spouse, a husband.\\nAnd countless Americans lie in bed at night staring up at the ceiling wondering, “What happens — what happens if I get sick?  What happens if I get prostate cancer and my wife gets breast cancer?  What do we do?  How do we take care of the family?  Who’s going to pay for it?  What’s going to happen?”  Thousands and thousands of Americans stare at that ceiling.\\nSo we did it with the idea that, in America, healthcare should be a right, not a privilege.  And, well, with the help of the leaders here, at a federal and state level, we began to make some good — good on the proposition of fighting and defending and improving the Affordable Care Act after it got passed.\\nYou know, if we can hold for a second here, remember — my colleagues remember I was out of office one year as Vice President, at the end of the term, in the 2018 elections.\\nAnd you remember, the other team wanted to do away with Obamacare.  They had scores of court cases, scores of votes to try to eliminate it.  But what happened was a lot of people didn’t — Barack is kind of a humble guy.  And I used to say to him after we won that Affordable Care fight — I said, “We ought to take a victory lap, let people know what happened.”  He said, “We don’t have time.  We don’t have time.”\\nWell, guess what?  I went into 58 races that year to campaign where there was an incumbent Republican and a Democrat running, and (inaudible) Republicans who wanted to eliminate the Affordable Care Act.  And what I pointed out was: If, in fact, that Republican won that year and they took back the Congress, what was going to happen?  Anyone with a preexisting condition could not get coverage again, not just through the Affordable Care Act, but couldn’t get coverage in your personal insurance you paid for.\\nAnd all of a sudden, people went, “Whoa, we won 44 of those races.”  And the one thing knowing they were going to eliminate — eliminate the idea that if you have a preexisting condition, you couldn’t get coverage.  You — now you can under the Affordable Care Act.\\nWithin the first months of my administration, we passed the landmark American Rescue Plan, a law that not only helped us get COVID-19 under control and our economy back on track, but got millions of people more — people insured more — millions of people more insured under the Affordable Care Act.\\nWe made it easier for people to sign up for coverage in the middle of the pandemic.  We opened a Special Enrollment Period and gave millions of Americans more time to enroll in the Affordable Care Act.\\nWe quadrupled the number of navigators out in the communities helping folks know how to sign up to get the coverage.\\nAnd here in the Washington State, about 240,000 folks signed up for ACA coverage just last year — an additional 240,000.  And we are continuing to expand Medicaid in states.\\nYou know, there are a total of 36 states who said we’re going to cover — even though the federal government was saying we’re going to cover for free in the beginning, and they have to eventually sign on to help pay for it.\\nWell, we added two more states.  That’s millions of people who have now Medicaid coverage.\\nOver 31 million Americans now have health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.  And that includes — (applause).  And that includes nearly 900,000 people across the state of Washington.\\nFour out of five Americans can find quality coverage for under $10 a month on the Affordable Care Act.\\nWe made it cheaper to purchase the premium plans under the Affordable Care Act.  The average family today, since we passed that law in our administration, are saving $2,400 on their annual premiums and getting better coverage.\\nThat’s $200 savings every month, allowing them to have more money available for other needs in their lives with inflation, with Putin’s gas tax, with their groceries because of the loss of access to the wheat fields in Russia and in Ukraine, prescription drugs, and other necessities.  That $200 can make a difference in a month.\\nThe bottom line is this: The Affordable Care Act is stronger now than it’s ever been.  And we’re strengthening it even further.\\nEarlier this month, I signed an executive order directing the federal agencies to continue doing everything they can in their power to expand — to expand the quality of the affordable healthcare coverage.\\nThis work builds on what we’ve done to end those surprise charges you often see on medical bills, particularly at hospitals.  If any of you have been hospitalized — I hope you haven’t had to, but if you’ve been lately and you found out your coverage doesn’t cover a certain particular doctor, you tend to get a surprise bill for a couple thousand bucks because, without your knowledge, they had another doctor looking at what was — what you needed to do.  No surprise bills anymore.  They can’t do that.  They can’t do that.  No more surprise medical billing.\\nAnd separately, we’re fixing — (applause).  And separately, we’re fixing what was referred to as the “family glitch”.  What — that is a common issue facing 5 million Americans who can’t get financial help or get coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\\nHere’s the problem: Under the current rules, a working mom is told that as long as she can afford employer-based coverage herself, she can’t qualify for premium subsidies in the Affordable Care Act to afford coverage for the rest of her family.  And so, we changed that.\\nWe proposed that, starting next year, working families will get the help they need to afford family coverage under the Affordable Care Act.  And as a result, these families will save hundreds of dollars a month.\\nWith this change, it’s estimated that 200,000 presently uninsured Americans will gain coverage.  Nearly one million Americans — (applause) — nearly one million Americans will see their coverage become more affordable.  This is considered one of the best things — the biggest thing my administration can do is lower costs and expand coverage.\\nWe talked about — you know, I’ve talked about and it was mentioned by several who spoke before me about just a little breathing room.\\nI was raised in a town in Delaware.  It was a nice neighborhood.  It was four — a three-bedroom split-level home in a developing suburban area — a housing development.  That — with four kids, a mom and a dad, and a grandpop living with us.\\nAnd the walls were thin.  And you could hear — I remember, one day — this is a true story — one day, I could — one night I hear my dad was really restless getting up and down.  And I asked my mom the next morning before I went to school what was wrong with Dad.\\nShe said, “They told him, honey, that they’re not going to cover insurance any more in his job.”  Health insurance.\\nWell, like I said, it’s about dignity.  It’s about worrying about your family.\\nSo, we need to keep this fight up.  And Republicans and I — as you know, I get criticized by the press because I’m not — I’m not partisan enough, okay?\\nWell, this is not your father’s Republican Party, as I said.  They continue to attack the Affordable Care Act and want to eliminate it.  They’re unrelenting.  Multiple court challenges, sabotage from the previous administration, over 70 attempts to repeal the law by Republicans in Congress.  Seventy times.\\nIn fact, just last month, Republican Senator Jon — excuse me, Ron Johnson from Wisconsin said that if the Republicans get back in power and take back the House and the Senate, they should repeal the Affordable Care Act again.\\nTwelve years later, Republicans still haven’t stopped their attacks on this lifesaving law.\\nSo, pay close attention.  If they have their way, it means 100 million Americans with a preexisting condition will once again be denied health — be denied health coverage — not hyperbole; this is a fact — will be denied healthcare coverage by their insurance companies.  That’s what the law was before Obamacare.\\nIn addition, tens of millions of Americans could lose their coverage, including young people, who will no longer be able to be covered by their parents’ plans up to age 26.  Premiums are going to go through the roof.  So, there’s a lot at stake.\\nWell, I’ve got a better idea: Instead of destroying\\nthe Affordable Care Act, let’s keep building on it.\\nExtend the American Rescue Plan subsidies that we’ve already passed, allowing premiums and expanded coverage — lower premiums, expanded coverage.\\nClose the Medicaid coverage gap that locks nearly 4 million Americans out of coverage just because they’re in states who refused to expand Medicaid.\\nAnd let’s do something that will bring down prices, lower the cost of prescription drugs.\\nLet me note parenthetically: The only thing that Medicare cannot negotiate with healthcare providers on are drugs.  They can tell you they’re only going to pay X amount of money for doctor visits, Y amount of money for a particular operation, et cetera.  But the only thing they can’t negotiate are prescription drugs, except for one area.\\nWe insisted a long time ago that the department that relates to the military — you have a great guy running Veterans Affairs now.  Veterans Affairs can say, “We’re not going to pay you any more than X or Y for this particular drug.”  But you can’t do that for anything else — Medicare can’t do that anywhere else.\\nIn America, we pay the highest prescription drug cost\\nof any developed nation in the world.  That’s a fact.  It’s about two and a half to three times higher than paid for the same exact drug, the same manufacturer in other countries.\\nFor example, the anti-cancer drug to treat leukemia and lymphoma costs $1,400 [$14,000] a month in the United States.  Some of you may know that.  The same exact drug, the same exact company, same distribution costs $6,000 — not $14,000 — in France.  Same company.  American company.  Same exact amount.  It’s unconscionable.\\nToday, one in four Americans who need prescription drugs struggle to afford them.\\nNearly 30 percent of people needing essential drugs — doses that they’re supposed to take — 30 percent skipped their doses because they want to extend life of the drug that they need.\\nMany people use over-the-counter drugs instead, and they cut pills in half because they can’t afford them.  And there’s others who simply not fill their prescriptions at all.\\nAs I said, for God’s sake, this is the United States of America.  What are we doing?  It’s simply wrong, especially since it doesn’t cost the drug companies nearly as much to make the drug or the research that went into it.\\nThere’s a system they have, noted in Germany and other countries, that the drug company can charge — the price is set when they — when they, in fact, try to bring the drug on market.  It’s like, in our case, the FDA approve it.  And the way it works is: They go, “How much did you invest to come up with the drug?  How much did you put in?”  And they allow a healthy profit of 10, 20, 30, 40 percent and say, “That’s what you can sell it for in our country unless you invest more to improve the drug and show you put more into it.  Otherwise, it can’t go below the cost of inflation.”\\nLook, the insulin we’re talking about: You know how much it makes — costs to make that vial of insulin?  Ten dollars.  T-E-N.  Ten dollars to treat diabetes.  Ten dollars.  A condition that affects millions of Americans, including a congresswoman.\\nLook, some families have to pay hundreds of dollars a month, some even over a thousand dollars.  The average cost is $863 a month — or, excuse me, $683 a month for lifesaving insulin.\\nYou just heard Elisa and Julia [Juliana] talk about trying to afford insulin and treat the Type 1 diabetes.\\nImagine what it’s like if you don’t have insurance and you don’t have the cash to look at your child, knowing what they need and knowing there’s not a damn thing you can do about it.\\nNot only is your child put in jeopardy, you’re deprived of your dignity.  How do you look at your child and deal with it?  There’s no excuse.  None.  We’re not asking drug companies to do anything that they can’t afford.  And if you think it doesn’t affect you, it does.\\nEveryone has less money in their pocket today because of the high cost of healthcare.  Over the past decade, healthcare costs have gone up 50 percent, and a major reason of that increase is the cost of the drugs in healthcare.\\nFolks, while we may not agree on everything, I think it’s safe to say that all of us, whatever our background, our age, where we live, agree that prescription drugs are outrageously expensive.\\nSo, here’s what I’m proposing — (applause).\\nI met with the 12 largest drug manufacturers when I did the initiative the Pres- — the last President, Obama, when I was Vice President, allowed me to do to deal with the cost of this.  And I met with them.  And I said — they said, “What if you find the cure for a particular drug?  What should you be able to charge for a major cancer facility?”  They said, “Whatever the market will bear.”\\nI said, “No.”  I said, “Here’s the deal — here’s what I think you should do: If you have to spend millions of dollars, you should be able to recoup everything you put into it.  But if it’s way beyond the cost of the average American, the federal government should step up and compensate you for it so that the — in fact, the American people can still have lifesaving drugs.”\\nSo, here’s what I’m proposing, with the help of the members of Congress:\\nFirst, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month.  That still means — it costs them $10 — three and a half times as much it costs them.  (Applause.)\\nSecond, let’s end the days when companies could increase prices with no oversight and no accountability.\\nIf drug companies increase their prices faster than the rate of inflation, they should have to face a steep tax.  We’re saying that — by the way, we wouldn’t let utility companies do it.  Utilities can’t, all of a sudden, raise their cost of the utilities you’re paying.  We’re saying, “Drug companies, you are finally going to be held accountable when you raise prices for the American people.”  You should be able to make a significant profit, but not gouge.\\nThird, let’s cap the amount that seniors on Medicare\\nhave to spend for prescription drugs each year.\\nIf you’re on Medicare, you won’t have to spend more than $2,000 out of pocket, which is a lot of money, and that’s no more than $170 a month no matter how many prescriptions you’re taking, because Medicare will take up the rest.  (Applause.)\\nDrug companies, insurance companies, Medicare would pick up the rest of the cost.\\nAnd finally, let’s give Medicare the power to negotiate\\nprescription drug prices.  For every other type of healthcare — (applause) — uses it to leverage lower prices for American seniors.\\nBut for prescription drugs, the only prescription drugs\\nMedicare is prohibited by law from negotiating to get the best deal for seniors.\\nAnd by the way, it doesn’t put the drug company — we’re just saying we’re not going to — Medicare is not going to buy it.  They’re not going to buy it beyond a certain price.\\nIt doesn’t mean you can’t continue to manufacture and ask a billion dollars for it.  But the federal government is not going to pay for it.\\nIt’s long past time we get rid of these absurd limitations.  Let Medicare negotiate pri- — fair prices that reflect the cost of research and development and the need for a significant profit but also affordable for seniors.\\nLet me close with this: I grew up in family where if prices went up for things that were daily requirements like the gallon of gasoline, it became a discussion at the kitchen table.  It mattered.  It was always on the margins.  We felt it.\\nThat’s why I’m so focused on doing everything I can to lower the cost of gas and energy, and accelerate our transition to clean energy.  I also know there are other basic needs that affect the standard of living for most families.\\nI was a single dad, as I said, for five years.  I couldn’t afford childcare.  No way I could.  But I had a sister and a brother.  We have an expression in my family — for real, not a joke — “If you have to ask, it’s too late.”  Think about what that means.\\nSo, when my wife and daughter were killed and the boys came home from the hospital, I found out my sister and her husband had already moved into my house.  I had bought a — I had purchased an old farmhouse — a colonial farmhouse in northern Delaware.  And it had a little barn on it as well.  It was only a couple acres.\\nMy brother came in and spent money changing the barn and the — the upstairs of the barn into an apartment.  My brother and sister moved in.\\nI’d dropped my kids off every morning when I’d go to the train station with my mom.\\nBut look, as I said, I had a good job.  How do people make it?\\nBut I know childcare is hard.  It costs a lot of money.  That’s why, with your members of Congress — led by Patty, who’s an absolute leader on this — I want to cap the child- — the ch- — the cost of childcare for families making under $125,000 to 7 percent of your income.  (Applause.)\\nWe can do these things without raising taxes a penny to anyone, as I said, making over — under 400,000 bucks.\\nThe bottom line is this: When I was running for the President, you heard me say a thousand times — you probably got tired of it, and you’re tired of it now — that we’re going to build this economy around you, the American middle class.  We’re going to — because when the middle class does well, the poor have a way up and the wealthy do very well.  They never hurt when the middle class is doing well.\\nAnd we’re going to deal in people and the places that have been left out and left behind.  And we’re making progress.\\nOver the course of my presidency — so far, 14 months — we’ve created 7.9 million good-paying jobs.  More jobs created in 14 months than any presidency in a year ever.  (Applause.)\\nThe unemployment rate is 3.6 percent, down from 6.4 percent when I took office.  The fastest decline in unemployment at the start of any presidency ever recorded.\\nWashington State, you’ve added 218,000 jobs, and unemployment dropped from 6.3 to 4.2 percent.\\nLast year, in 2021, we cut — (applause) — and all this was going on.  We cut the deficit.  You know, my — all my friends talk about how they care about the deficit?  We cut it $350 billion last year.  (Applause.)\\nAnd this year, in 2022, we’re on track to cut the deficit by more than — I want — mark it down because you’ll — you’ll remind me of this — by $1.3 trillion — 1.3.  (Applause.)  If that stays on course, it’d be the largest one-year reduction of a deficit in history.\\nThis is particularly important now as we work to reduce pressure on inflation.  From Washington State to all across America, we’ve gone from “on the mend” to “on the move.”\\nWe’re coming at our — at our challenges from a position of strength.\\nI’m more optimistic.  I’m more optimistic about America today than I’ve been in my whole life and my whole career, because I fee- — see a future that’s within our grasp.\\nWe’re the only nation on Earth — think about this now — we’re the only nation on Earth that has always come out of every crisis we’ve ever met stronger than when we went in it.  No other nation in the world can say that.  It’s because of you, because of the ingenuity and determination of the American people.\\nWe’ve — we’ve — we’ve just looked at opportunity and seized it.  That’s exactly what we’re doing today.\\nSo as my Grandfather Finnegan used to say, “With the grace of God and the goodwill of the neighbors and the crick not rising, we’re going to do well.”\\nIt’s going to be hard for a while getting through the cost of gasoline and energy because of Putin and the war, but we’re going to do it.\\nAnd with your help — and I say to all the folks who are students here, I wish you well.  We need you badly.  You’re — and the reason I’m so optimistic — think about it — you are the least prejudiced, the most involved, the most concerned generation in American history.  You really are.  (Applause.)\\nSo, thank you.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.\\nGod bless you all.  Appreciate it.  Thanks.  (Applause.)\\n1:54 P.M.

Unidos. It’s incredibly special to be here with you in San Antonio.Earlier today, the White House celebrated the signing of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act—the most significant gun safety law in 30 years.You know, when Joe and I visited Uvalde, I stood in front of those 21 crosses, and touched the pictures of the bright, beautiful faces that would never again laugh, or open birthday presents, or tell their parents that they loved them. And I knew that a piece of Uvalde would always be a part of me. Like all of you, Joe and I think about those families—and all who carry that grief—every day.  When we were leaving the school, someone shouted “Do something!” And I’m proud that Joe has. He will continue to do everything he can and to call on Congress to act, including on measures that ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We are committed to building a safer, healthier, more prosperous, and fair America. And I know that Unidos is as well—and has been since the very start. In fact, I was reminded of the transformational power of this organization when Joe awarded your longtime leader, Raul Yzaguirre, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, our country’s highest civilian honor. Raul has dedicated his life to working for so many civil liberties: from fighting poverty to improving education to advancing voting rights. But one of the most powerful things that he did through this organization was to bring the Latino community together. Because he understood that unity is powerful. And he challenges us to be just as brave and bold.It’s a reminder that we all need—now more than ever.   A little over a month ago, I had the opportunity to give a commencement to Los Angeles City College students. The crowd was a majority Latino, but the students didn’t share one story. There were immigrants, and first-generation Americans, and Angelenos whose families have lived on this land since long before it was called the United States. There were engineers and artists, veterans and students who are going on to four-year colleges. They didn’t share one path or dream. But as I saw the joy in their faces, I could see that they did have one thing in common: Each of them will bring exceptional gifts and talents to their corner of our country—and will make their community stronger by being a part of it.\\nYes, the Latino community is unique. But what I’ve heard from you again and again is that you want what all families want. Good schools. Good jobs. Safe neighborhoods. You want justice and equality—the opportunity to build a better life for your families.It’s not only what all families want; it’s what all families deserve. But we can’t get those things on our own.Raul helped build this organization with the understanding that the diversity of this community—as distinct as the bodegas of the Bronx, as beautiful as the blossoms of Miami, and as unique as the breakfast tacos here in San Antonio—is your strength. And yet, it’s when you speak with one voice—unidos—that you find your power.   Thanks to the hard work of you and advocates across the country, we have torn down so many of the barriers that kept Latinos out of our seats of power. But your voice hasn’t always been listened to, has it? A few years ago, I met with a group of bright, ambitious young Latino leaders. And they told me that there were times when they didn’t feel heard. They asked me: How can our leaders work for us if they don’t work with us?It’s an idea that’s always been at the heart of Joe’s work. If you want to know what a community needs—ask them. Give them a seat at the table and then listen to what they have to say. And he’s done just that. He’s appointed Latinos to the highest offices in his cabinet. He made sure that legislation like the American Rescue Plan focused on equity. His team worked with all of you—Unidos and so many of the affiliates here today—to get Latinos vaccinated, fight hunger, and invest in your small businesses.  And let me say how grateful we are to everyone who has been a partner in that work. It’s because you are on the frontlines that our team can meet Latinos and all Americans where they are. We’ve made progress together. And I’m so proud of what Joe has done to pass bipartisan legislation, like the infrastructure and gun bills. I’m proud that he recovered all private sector jobs lost during the pandemic, reopened schools, and cut child poverty in half. You were right to put your faith in him two years ago. But I also know that we need to do so much more. We will never make the changes we need when so many of our leaders refuse to work together. When politicians block legislation that the majority of Americans want: A ban on guns that only belong on a battle field. The right to make our own decisions about our own bodies. Universal child care, and community college, and ending child poverty. Congress is supposed to represent the will of the people. And that’s why we the people need to speak up. All of us—united. We need to vote—in races at every single level. And we need to remember that voting is the bare minimum. We have to get involved in the local governments that decide how cities plan their budgets and protect their students. We have to speak up for justice and equity. We have to demand that we the people be heard—to follow the example you have set.  For decades, this organization has brought people together. You’ve built coalitions and helped this community raise its voice. You’ve envisioned a better world and done the difficult work to make it real. You do your part every day—and Joe and I are committed to doing the same. The road ahead won’t be easy, but we’re with you in this fight—now and always. Your longtime leader, Raul, once said: “When things aren’t going your way, you have to have something to sustain you, and having a love for your community is one thing that will sustain you.” I see that love here today. A love that gives us the strength to speak up, even when we’re tired. That helps us come together, to cross any divide. That believes in the best of who we are—and knows that justice is within our reach as long as we never give up on each other.Your fight is our fight and we will stand with you—in unity, equity, and love. Thank you.\\n###   \n",

Washington Convention CenterWashington, D.C.\\n5:19 P.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everyone.  They tell me there are a few people out there watching.  (Laughter.) MS. PRINGLE:  A couple thousand.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  A couple thousand.But, look, before I begin my formal comments, as Jill and your president spoke, it reminded me of two things.  One is that because of your help, because we were able to pass the American Rescue Plan, we’re able to get millions of shots in people’s arms and provide vaccines around the world and change the circumstances. This week — this Friday — they announced the new employment figures.  Another 800-and-some-thousand jobs created this week.  We’ve now created more jobs since you got me sworn in than any president in American history in the same timeframe. We are in a situation where we are doing things that I think are going to fundamentally change the trajectory of this country.  I told you a long time ago: It’s not just the NEA and unions; it’s about building America from the middle up and the middle out, not trickling down.  There’s a lot — a lot we can do.  A lot more we can do.And, folks, you know, the projected growth rate, before we started — I just was doing this earlier this morning — was to be half of what it is now.  It’s expected to be over 7.2 percent the economy is going to grow this year.  That means thousands and thousands and thousands and millions of jobs.  And we’re just getting started.So I want to thank you, Madam President, and congratulate you on your first representative assembly of the NEA.  (Applause.)  And Jill and I wanted to congratulate you all on the 100th anniversary of this convening.  And notwithstanding rumors, I was not at the first convening.  (Laughter.)The NEA is one of America’s indispensable organizations.  I’m not just saying that because the First Lady is a member.  And, by the way, I noticed — I noticed that what you all — I knew what you all were going through.  Jill taught full-time this semester.  Full-time.  I watched Jill getting ready to teach her classes. And going back to school herself, learning how to work online — and rapidly work online — and to teach online, it gave me an appreciation firsthand that I thought I had, but I wouldn’t have had had I not seen it.  And then going out and teaching — she was working four or five hours a day, getting ready to teach, putting her lesson plans together a different — a different way.And you all went through that.  All of you went through that.And again, I’m not saying this because of something Jill — you know, I would — the truth: If I didn’t support the NEA, I’d be sleeping in the Lincoln Bedroom alone.  But — and that’s not where we sleep.  We don’t sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom.  (Laughs.)  I’d be sent down to it.But, you know, look, as Jill always says: Teaching is not what she does, it’s who she is.  It’s who all of you are.  Our children are the kite strings upon which our national ambitions are lifted aloft.  And your profession — your profession helps them believe they can do anything.For that, and so much more, we just wanted to thank you. Thank you all for what you do and what you continue to do.And, President Pringle, you and I have something in common:  We both took our current roles at a time of incredible challenge and incredible opportunity.Over the last year, the entire country has witnessed the extraordinary dedication and resolve of the NEA members — teachers, professionals, who had to be not just educators, but tech support, social workers, often while trying to take care of their own children. Other public employees who kept vital services up and running.  I saw the bus drivers dropping off meals instead of picking up kids.  Support staff had to become sanitation experts, making sure school buildings were safe.  And tech experts making sure everyone could connect to the Internet from home.You know, there’s been so much heroic work to help children stay connected to school and to each other.  The American people saw it.  They get it.  And they understand what you’ve been saying for years: that you are professionals, all of you.  All of you.  All of us have a responsibility to make sure that you have what you need to educate our children safely, equitably, and well. That’s why I made it a priority to get educators vaccinated and reopen schools as quickly as possible.  Nationwide, 84 percent of K-through-12 educators and school staff are fully vaccinated, and they were by the end of May.  Even more have gotten the vaccination since — the vaccine since.But as I’ve said many times, it’s not enough just to get back to normal.  We have to build back better than ever, especially our education system.That’s why the American Rescue Plan made such historic investments.  It was $1.9 trillion, and people said we could never get it passed.  With your help, we did, and we transformed the country — began to transform the country — providing funding for state and local governors and school districts to make sure schools are safe and to keep you on the job and in the classrooms.  Funding for summer learning and tutoring programs and hiring nurses and counselors.Now we have an opportunity to make the game-changing investments for educators, students, and families, and make it even better.We’re in a competition in the 21st century — a worldwide competition.  And as Jill says often, “Any country that out-educates us is going to out-compete us.”  We have to build for the 21st century because the rest of the world is not sitting around and waiting.The bipartisan infrastructure agreement we just reached is going to deliver reliable high-speed Internet to every American.  Every single American.  And they’re going to be affordable, in rural and in urban areas.Of the many things — of the many tough images this past year were children sitting in cars in fast-food parking lots because it was the only place they could get a Wi-Fi connection for remote schooling.If we didn’t know — if we didn’t know it before, we do now: High-speed Internet is essential like electric and clean air — like electricity and clean water.And speaking of clean water, this agreement that we put together will put Americans to work in good-paying union jobs, replacing 100 percent of lead water pipes in this country.  One hundred percent.Right now, there are 400,000 schools — and some of you teach in them — 400,000 schools and childcare centers with lead pipes.  We know even that low levels of lead can cause behavior and learning problems in children, impairing their growth.This deal contains the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history.  It would end the threat of lead-contamination — contaminated water once and for all.My American Families Plan — which we’re now trying to get done as well — calls for an historic investment in human infrastructure; guaranteeing four additional years of public education for everyone, starting as early as we can; universal high-quality preschool for three- and four-year-olds.  And all the data shows how that increases their prospect, no matter what environment they come from, to do better and make it through school.  Two years of free community college.  And high-quality, affordable childcare for working families.It would no longer cost — excuse me, it would lower the cost of lower-income — for lower-income students going to school — the Pell grants.  We’d provide an additional mil- — 1.5 — $1,500 in Pell grants.It will also make a $9 billion investment in educators so we can address teacher shortages, diversify our pipeline of teachers, and improve teacher training and teacher mentoring.  And, critically, it would extend and expanded the Child Tax Credit, which will significantly benefit working families.What that means: Instead of deducting $2,000 per child off the bottom line of your taxes, –which doesn’t do too much for families who don’t have a big tax bill to begin with — pretty soon, before this month is out, families are going to get a significant check.  For every child under the age of six, you’ll get $3,600 per child.  For every child 6 to 17, you’ll get $3,000 — not as a credit against your taxes that a lot of educators and school staff aren’t really going to feel.  You’ll get cash.  Cash.Starting the middle of this month, you’ll start to get monthly payments between now and the end of the year.  For example, if you have one child, and you’re going to get — you’re going to get $3,600.  Between now and January, you’ll get $1,800 of that on a monthly basis between now and January.  And between January and December, you’ll get the other $1,800.Folks, this is a major tax break for working families, and my family plan will extend it for five years.  The very — this year’s plan is estimated to cut child poverty in half.  In half.  The Child Tax Care [Credit].So, look, folks — (applause) — I’m also working with Congress to support $100 billion in school infrastructure investments, making sure that our schools are safe, that you have the technology you need to prepare for students of the future — something that I’ve always cared deeply about.My budget invests $20 billion more in Title I schools.  No student — no student’s education should depend on their ZIP code.  It would represent a historic effort to close the funding gap between rich and poor districts.And one of the first things that funding will be used for is to help educators in those schools get the raises they deserve and the resources they need.  (Applause.)And, by the way, if I’d note, this isn’t just — it’s not that I’m trying to be nice.  This is absolutely necessary — necessary if we’re going to compete in the 21st century.  Think about it: The idea that we have a large portion of our student population living in ZIP codes where they cannot afford the kind of education and can’t pay the teachers enough in those schools to educate them, it makes no sense.  The people that are going to benefit the most from this is corporate America and businesses because they’re going to have a better-educated public, better-educated students. Your union and teachers’ protests across the country made it clear that you deserve more than praise.  You deserve a raise, not just praise.  (Applause.)And, folks, every parent in this country who spent the last year helping educate their children at home understand you deserve a raise.  (Applause.)  They figured it out.  (Applause.)  No, I’m serious.  Think about it.  Think about it.It was the ultimate education of the public going through this pandemic. My budget would also allow us to invest more in counselors, social workers, community schools, nutrition support, and a whole lot more.  (Applause.)I have a lot more to say, but I’m going to get the hook from Jill if I keep talking.  (Laughter.) No, but let’s — so let me close with this: On Sunday, we’ll celebrate our independence as a nation, as well as our progress against the virus.  In the days ahead, we have a chance to make another beginning — the beginning of a stronger, fairer education system.  But it can’t be done — it can’t be done with you.  We can’t do it alone.  We need to keep getting the word out about the opportunities that lies ahead for us. So, let’s make this happen together.  I really mean this.  This is a — this is a campaign in and of itself.  Jill and I are proud of you.  We’re grateful to you.  And I really mean that. You know, I think about it: Why would a kid like me, from Scranton and Claymont, Delaware, be standing here as your President of the United States of America, were it not for the people who educated me, the teachers I had?  It made a difference.  They took a stuttering kid who couldn’t — couldn’t — couldn’t — couldn’t speak very well in school, was scared to death to be called on to read out loud. And they nurtured me: “Joey — you’re a very smart boy, Joey.  Just take your time.  Don’t let that get in your way, Joey.”  I’m serious.  I think what you all underestimate, beyond the teaching of reading and writing, adding and subtracting: You give so many kids confidence. You let them believe in themselves.  I’m not joking.  Think about yourself, your own — you can name the teachers who helped change your life.  You can name them.  I can still name them.  I know who the — the people who made a difference in my life, made me believe I could do anything.  When, if you looked at the background, there’s no reason why, coming from my circumstance.  We weren’t — it wasn’t poverty, just — just making it.  But you did it, and don’t forget it.  Don’t forget how much difference you make. Those of you who’ve been teaching a while, you have experiences like Jill has.  People will come up to Jill and say, “Mrs. Biden, you had — I had your English class.  I can’t thank you…”  “What are you doing now?”  “Well, I have my doctorate, and I’m teaching at such and such.”  Or a fireman putting out a fire in our home: “Mrs. Biden…” — as his gear coming out of a house that almost burned down — “Mrs. Biden, you had me.  You had me as a teacher, and you taught me English.”  Think of the people’s lives you change. You know, I’m supposed to stop but I’m going to say a couple more things — (laughter) — because I — I really don’t think you understand or you appreciate just how important you are.  I really mean it.  I genuinely mean it from the bottom of my heart.I was overseas at what they call the G7 — the biggest economies in the world — and then with the NATO people, and then I met with Putin.  And in the process of doing all of this, I was asked at one point, “Can you define America for me?”  And I give you my word to this.  I said, “Yes…” — and I believe this, and I repeated it again today as I swore in new citizens, young people in the White House.  I said, “I can define America” — and I mean it from the bottom of my heart — “in one word: possibilities.”  It’s the only nation in the world where we think we can do anything. Now, why do we think that?  Not a joke.  Why do we think that?  Why do we think anything is possible?  It’s not just the system.  It’s the people who look out for us. I’ve said a hundred times, you control — you, the teachers, determine what this country is going to look like.  You are the people who take our children and nurture them.  As I said many times, they’re the kite string — you’re the kite strings upon which we lift our national ambitions aloft.  So, have — understand how important you are.And, by the way, understand how important that cafeteria worker is who looks at that kid who’s a little bit ashamed that they have no food at home and says, “Honey, here.  Here is a little more.  Take some more.”  Or packs a little bag without telling them after they have lunch and slips it to them.  You provide their dignity.  You give them dignity.So, I really mean it: I think you’re the single most important component of America’s future.  So don’t give up on yourselves, and I know you won’t.  Don’t give up on these kids.  Give them hope.  Make them believe in themselves.  And make sure when they’re much older, and they say, “How’d you get here?”  “Because Mrs. Jones or Mr. Williams,” or whomever.  Because it will be done.  It will be done.Thank you.  Thank you for all you do, all you give, and all that you are to your students and to the nation.  You know you affect your students, but it’s to the nation.God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.  Thank you so much.  (Applause.)\\n5:38 P.M.

theories about the origins of COVID ahead of the WHO report on the origins of COVID?THE PRESIDENT:  Do I have —Q    Any theories on the origins of the coronavirus —THE PRESIDENT:  No — no, I don’t.  I have theories, but I’m not a scientist.  I’m going to wait until the scientific community makes that judgment.Q    You spoke to the British Prime Minister.  What was the conversation about?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we talked a lot about climate change.  We talked a lot about the need also for Britain and the United States to — to stand together and deal with the whole notion of whether or not NATO stands together, whether we stand united, and whether or not I’d be able to come, and I hope I can, to the NATO meeting in — I think it’s in late June.  So we talked about scheduling and when I come over and how we’d work that out.Q    Any commitments on either side during the call?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there was full agreement.  One of the things I suggested to do is — we talked about China and the competition they’re engaging in in the Belt and Road Initiative.  And I suggested we should have, essentially, a similar initiative coming from the democratic states, helping those communities around the world that, in fact, need help.Q    What does it mean to have Baby Beau on the plane with you, on Air Force One?THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  It’s really great.Q    President Biden, you issued strong words about the Georgia voting bill —THE PRESIDENT:  Not — not as strong as I was really thinking.Q    Is there anything the White House can do to protect voting rights in Georgia?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re working on that right now.  We don’t know quite exactly what we can do at this point.  The Justice Department is taking a look as well.Q    Mr. President, how does the voting issue affect your thinking on the filibuster?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, look, we’ll see.  The question is whether or not — you know, you have to have 50 votes — 51 votes to have to win to be able to move the filibuster and any change in the filibuster.  And right now, that doesn’t exist.  That doesn’t exist.So, you know, look, I — the only thing I’ve been relatively good at in my long career in the Senate is figuring out when to move and when not to move.  We got to have the votes.Q    (Inaudible) gun control?Q    Can we expect any gun control executive orders?   THE PRESIDENT:  Pardon me?Q    Can we expect any gun control executive orders soon?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re looking at that right now.  We’re looking at what kind of authority I have relative to imported weapons, as well as whether or not I have any authority to — these new weapons that are being made by 3D equipment that aren’t registered as guns at all, there may be some latitude there as well.Q    On the Suez Canal, sir: What offer has the DOD, has the Pentagon made to help Egypt?  Can you say?  What all can the U.S. do to assist?   THE PRESIDENT:  We have equipment and capacity that most countries don’t have, and we’re seeing what we can do — what help we can be.Thank you.END   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\nU.S. Coast Guard Cutter Munro\\nSan Diego, California\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you all for being here.  It’s a great honor to be here on the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Munro on — on, really, a momentous day.\\nToday, here at this port, from this cutter, we will offload 39,000 pounds of cocaine that these Coast Guardsmen and women managed to capture at sea.  That’s 39,000 pounds of cocaine that will not go into our communities, will not tear at our families, that will not cost American lives.  And it was my great honor to be here today for this offload to really commend the crew of the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Munro for a job well done.\\nThis is one of our newest ships in the Coast Guard.  And they acquitted themselves with great distinction and courage on the open seas — even, as you are all aware, that — the interdiction of a semi-submersible ship, almost a submarine, that was filled with narcotics.\\nAnd the interdiction of 39,000 pounds of cocaine undoubtedly saved lives.  We’ve lost 70,000 Americans to cocaine overdose in the last 10 years.  And on the ocean, here in the Pacific, through the Gulf, it is the Coast Guard that is stepping into harm’s way and preventing those drugs from reaching our families and reaching our streets.  And so it was an honor for me to be able to be here today to commend them.\\nWe also know that not all the narcotics are coming over the ocean.  And tomorrow, I will be at the southern border — McAllen, Texas.  I’ll be leading a delegation of members of the Senate.  We’ll be going into a detention facility, but also being briefed on the very real crisis at our southern border.\\nBut make no mistake about it.  The crisis on our border that, in the last month alone, saw nearly 100,000 people come across our border in a single month alone — that crisis itself is not only exploiting vulnerable families in Central America, but also it’s making it more possible for drugs to flow across our southern border.  It’s one of the reasons that the drug traffickers and the drug cartels are fomenting the human trafficking that’s going on on our southern border.\\nSo we’re absolutely determined that — as President Trump has made clear again and again, that we’re going to end the crisis on our southern border, we’re going to secure our border, and we’re going to end the flow of drugs that’s tearing apart our communities and our families.\\nBut tomorrow I’ll be focused on that crisis on our southern border.  And specifically, we’ll be taking a delegation and literally taking cameras and the American people into a detention center to see the truly noble and honorable and compassionate work that our Customs and Border Protection people are doing every single day to deal with these families that have been exploited by human traffickers and drug cartels.\\nBut today is about the Coasties.  It’s about saying thank you to the Munro, hoping that they have a good rest back when they make it into their home port.  And really, to make sure the American people know that these men and women are out there putting their lives on the line, but they’re saving lives all over America.  And we just really couldn’t be more grateful for the work that they’ve done.\\nQ    Mr. Vice President —\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Please, go ahead.\\nQ    You’re obviously here today — you talk about the border wall.  You talk about, you know, just increased border safety.  Does that push the fight that these men and women here on this flight deck today see at sea?  And what kind of increase in safety can the U.S. government provide?\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think there’s no question that as we continue to secure our border, that we’re going to see the drug cartels attempt to use the open oceans to move narcotics, even more than they do today.  And I want to assure the American people that we’re going to continue to redouble our efforts to support the Coast Guard’s work.\\nI mean, I’m proud of the support this administration has provided to our military.  And the President and I couldn’t be more proud of the work the Coast Guard has done.  It’s one of the reasons why we’ve made a budget request for additional ships, additional resources for the Coast Guard.  The helicopter deployments — we’re calling for a 25 percent increase in what’s known as the HITRON program.  And we’ll continue to make sure that these men and women that are literally putting their lives on the line are able to meet any increasing threat from the drug cartels that comes in the open ocean.\\nQ    Mr. Vice President, you talk about compassionate care at the border.\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yes.\\nQ    However, there are some people who say that we need more compassionate care, or there’s not enough, or something has gone wrong.  You’re going to go to a detention facility tomorrow.\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  We are.\\nQ    But there are other facilities — we’ve seen pictures of them.  How do you reconcile what you’re going to probably see tomorrow with some of the pictures that the American people have seen and people here in San Diego are concerned about?\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, let me say that we’ll be visiting McAllen, Texas, which is one of the busiest ports of entry on our southern border.  And the detention facility in McAllen is one of the busiest on the border.  So we will get a very clear look at, I think, two things:\\nNumber one, I think we will see that our system is overwhelmed.  There’s no question.  I mean, you know, in the month of May, you know, more than 114,000 people came and crossed our border to claim — to make a claim of asylum and enter into our system.  It was nearly 100,000 in the month of June.\\nAnd for the first time ever, the vast majority of people presenting at our border are families with vulnerable children.  And the truth is, our system was simply never designed to accommodate what could, this year, well be over a million people coming across our border.\\nIt’s one of the reasons why President Trump and I have said since January that we have a crisis at our southern border.  The President declared an emergency so we could begin to build a wall on the southern border and that’s well under way.  He — we took steps to insist that Mexico do more.  And now they’re doing more than they’ve ever done before, deploying their national guard to their southern border and to our southern border.\\nWe think some of the reduction in the month of June — a 28 percent reduction — is largely owing to the efforts that Mexico has made and we’re very grateful for that.\\nBut two weeks ago, the President and I worked with leaders in both parties in Congress to secure an additional $4.6 billion in funding for humanitarian aid.  And, frankly, we were grateful that Democrats in Congress were willing to support it because, for the last six months, they were saying it was a manufactured crisis.  They were saying that our system wasn’t overwhelmed.\\nAnd now that they recognize there is a crisis — I think it’s an outrage that some Democrats in Congress are referring to U.S. Customs and Border facilities as “concentration camps.”  That’s totally unacceptable.\\nAnd tomorrow we’re going to take the cameras into one of the busiest detention centers on the southern border and the American people —\\nQ    Mr. Vice President —\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:   are going to be able to see for themselves every single day, our Customs and Border Protection provide compassionate and generous care to people that are crossing our border.  And we’re going to continue to see to it that that’s the case.\\nQ    Mr. Vice President —\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  What about — go ahead.\\nQ    When you talk about a manufactured crisis at the border — something that isn’t manufactured — there’s just tons of sewage flowing into San Diego here.  The mayor had a chance to bring it up to the President.  Are there plans to try to stifle that flow of sewage?  Border Patrol says it puts its agents at risk.  We have to close beaches here all the time.  Is the White House even aware of this problem?\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, I — what I will do is, today, I will follow back up with that.  I don’t know if the President has had any interaction with the mayor on that topic.\\nBut, look, this is a beautiful city.  Frankly, it’s — my wife and I have been very moved to be back in San Diego — not just celebrating a great military tradition here, but the beauty of the bay and the quality of life here is something that we want to support.  And so we’ll be looking into that.\\nQ    Mr. Vice President, you extended —\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible.)\\nQ    — you extended an invitation to —\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.\\nQ    You extended an invitation to all of the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee —\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  I did.\\nQ    — including the Democrats.  At this point, you haven’t heard back that any of them are coming.  They have said that they think that this move might be a political one.  What’s your message to them?\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, we did.  We worked with the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee to invite all of the members — the Republicans and Democrat members — of the Senate Judiciary Committee to tour the detention facility at the McAllen section of the border.\\nAnd I’m disappointed that, at this hour, it does appear that any Democrats are willing to take the time to come and tour a detention facility, particularly when some Democrats are using the most outrageous language and unsubstantiated claims to demean and discredit the noble work of Customs and Border Protection.\\nBut, look, here’s the thing: If the Democrats in the Senate don’t want to go, we’re still going to bring the American people, because at the Presidents direction, we’ve made it possible for the media to follow us in.  And we’re going to tour the facility —\\nQ    Is it true that they don’t even have water?\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  — and I will tell you, this is one of the busiest facilities on our southern border.  And I fully expect it — I fully expect it to be full.  I expect there to be evidence the system is overflowing.\\nBut I also know that what people are going to see is not the situation that many Democrats have described — with apparently not going and looking for themselves — but actually a situation where our Customs and Border Protection are providing humanitarian care; they’re providing healthcare, shelter, food, sustenance in a way that would make the American people proud.  It’s — but I want to be clear —\\nQ    So are you saying the pictures and the Democrats are lying?\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  I want to be clear that it’s — the system is overwhelmed and we fully expect it to reflect that tomorrow.  And it’s part of the reason, I think, the President wanted us to go — to bring the cameras in, so that we can continue to call on the Congress to make the changes in our asylum laws that’ll be necessary to stop the flow of migrants from Central America.\\nLet me be clear on this point: Human traffickers and drug cartels use the loopholes in American asylum laws to entice people to pay American cash to take the long and dangerous journey north to our border, where along the way, the majority face violence and abuse.  According to Doctors Without Borders, a third of young women who make the journey are sexually assaulted along the way.\\nI mean, all of this is a result of the ability for human traffickers to say that if you cross into our border and you read a certain set of words consistent with American asylum laws, that you’ll be able, essentially, to stay in a system that has been overwhelmed and has a vast backlog — in some cases, of years — of people to be processed.\\nBut that’s got to change.  That’s why we’ve got to reform our asylum laws, end catch-and-release, and really take the enticement away from the human traffickers who are exploiting vulnerable families in Central America every day and endangering lives and creating this crisis at our border.\\nQ    Mr. Vice President, your response to the National Guard Facebook group where they mocked dead children in the immigration areas?\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  The National Guard?\\nQ    The National Guard Facebook group that mocked dead children in immigration areas.\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, we have no tolerance of improper statements or callous statements like those that have been reported.  And I know that the Department of Homeland Security is investigating that matter as we speak.\\nQ    Mr. Vice President, your only ally in Congress — your only ally in Congress, Duncan Hunter, has been accused of misspending hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign funds.  What do you think about that?  And have there been talks of a pardon for Duncan Hunter?\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, I simply cannot comment on an ongoing criminal matter.\\nQ    I mean what — I mean, what are your thoughts about him allegedly misspending thousands of dollars on personal matters?\\nQ    Mr. Vice President, so just to clarify, would you say those pictures of the detention centers are or are not true?\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  I’m sorry.  Say again?\\nQ    The pictures of the detention centers, are those true?  Is it true that they don’t even have water?\\nQ    In some places.\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, everyone I speak to at Customs and Border Protection has told me — and in my own visits to our border in the past, I’ve seen our CBP personnel providing food, sustenance, healthcare, shelter in way that would make the American people proud.\\nBut we’re going to go to the detention facility tomorrow and we’ll see for ourselves.  And the American people are going to see.\\nQ    What about the pictures that are already there?\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  And I think they’re going to see — I think they’re going to see that those who are — and I have to tell you, look, that for six months the Democrats said that this was a manufactured crisis.  And so we welcome the fact that Democrats in Congress are now admitting that we have a crisis at our southern border.  We truly do.\\nWe were grateful Speaker Pelosi supported and helped move forward $4.6 billion to address the humanitarian needs that are created out of this crisis.\\nBut the statements by some Democrats in Congress — I mean, to refer to American Customs detention facilities as concentration camps is an outrage.  Nazis took lives and murdered people.  Our Customs and Border Protection save lives every day.\\nQ    Mr. Vice President, the words about the children being — taking their beds away, does that concern you?\\nQ    I was going to say, like kids have died though.\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Say again?\\nQ    There’s been reports of minors dying while they were under the custody of CBP.  So what do you say to (inaudible)?\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, our hearts break for the loss of life.  The images of the father and the little girl in the Rio Grande broke the heart of every American.  And — but the American people deserve to know that the human traffickers that are, in some cases, taking as much as $5,000 American to then take people on the long and dangerous journey north have no regard for human life.\\nAnd that — it’s the reason why we have to reform our asylum laws.  We have to take the tools away that they’re using to entice people to take the long and dangerous journey north.  But any loss of life —\\nQ    They’re — these families are already facing crime and violence in their own countries.  They come here to find a better opportunity.  So they’re not forced; they leave because they’re already facing crime and violence in their home countries.\\nQ    (Inaudible.)\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, the — look, I’ve been to the Northern Triangle.  I’ve met repeatedly with the Presidents of all three countries.  The United States of America is calling on them to do more.  President Trump has made it clear that our friends in Central America need to do more to interdict the human traffickers that are exploiting vulnerable families and costing lives.\\nBut make no mistake about it — look, we — this crisis at our southern border is harming the American people.  We are on track for as many as a million people to come into our country through the southern border this year.  And I want to be clear, with these courageous Coasties behind me and the incredible work that they’ve done — interdicting 39,000 pounds of cocaine — that as that crisis continues, it not only places a tremendous burden on our system and on the American people, but it also makes it more possible for the drug cartels — as our system is overwhelmed by this mass migration, it makes it easier for the drug cartels to move dangerous and illicit drugs into this country, tearing apart our families.\\nSo we’re going to continue to lean into this, that it really is all about saving lives.\\nQ    How closely is the President watching your visit?  How closely is the President monitoring what you saw here today but also what you’ll be seeing tomorrow?\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, look, the President and I talked a couple times yesterday; we talk every day when I’m on the road.  And I know how proud he is of the Coast Guard for this interdiction.  Think about this: In three months, apprehended 55 drug trafficking members of the cartels, 39,000 pounds of cocaine, about 1,000 pounds of marijuana.  And at great risk, at times, accomplished that.  And I know the President is very, very proud of them.\\nBut look, the President and I talked about us going and visiting the detention center at McAllen and he felt very strongly that we needed to bring the cameras in.  And so we’ve made it possible for that to occur.  And now the American people are going to be able to see it for themselves.\\nQ    With the Ridgecrest earthquake, do you think you and the President —\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  How about one more?  How about somebody that hasn’t —\\nQ    — the President and Governor Newsom can work on the Ridgecrest earthquake?\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Anybody else?\\nQ    Regarding the death of these children —\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I got you already —\\nQ    — what answer can you give?\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Say again?\\nQ    Regarding the deaths of the children in the detention centers, what answers can you give to the country or to the families?\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, we mourn with those who mourn and grieve with those who grieve.  And our hearts and our prayers go out to any families that have lost loved ones swept up in this crisis at our southern border.\\nIt’s part of why the President and I are so determined to secure our border, to call on Mexico to do more.  It’s why we fought so hard to get $4.6 billion in humanitarian aid, and it’s also why we’re going to continue to fight to reform our asylum laws, to take that tool away from human traffickers.\\nSo it is about care and concern for the American people.  But — and, frankly, about deep concern for the vulnerable families that are being exploited in this midst of this crisis.\\nQ    So when people are asking asylum and they’re turned away, then they find more dangerous ways of crossing the border, do you guys think about that — when they’re turned away when they’re trying to ask for asylum here at the border?\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  We — look, our immigration system in this country is broken.  And in the days ahead, you’re going to see our administration lay out a framework for really fixing this broken immigration system.\\nI say that as the grandson of an immigrant.  My grandfather came through Ellis Island, became an American.  That’s how I became Vice President of the United States.  The President’s grandfather immigrated to this country.  And we believe in legal immigration, but our system today is not working.  It’s not working for the American people.\\nAnd as we work to end this crisis at our southern border, rest assured, we are going to work diligently with everyone in Congress who will work with us to reform our immigration system and fix this broken system once and for all.\\nQ    You’re saying this administration is for legal immigration.  The President has proposed to cut legal immigration.  He said it to all the rallies, “We’re full.  We can’t take any more people.”  He wants to cut legal immigration.  So how do you say that?\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, I mean, the President speaks about that.  He speaks about the fact that we have an unprecedented migration coming across our southern border.  And the President has expressed a determination to enforce our border, to secure our border.  It’s the reason why we’re building the wall, it’s the reason why we called on Mexico — with the possibility of tariffs on all goods coming from Mexico — to do more.  And now they are doing more.  And it’s one of the reasons we continue to call on Congress to close the loopholes.\\nLook, we have — you look across this country, this economy is expanding rapidly.  We’ve created 6 million new jobs.  I mean, there are job openings all across the United States of America.  There are record job openings in the last month.  But what the President has communicated and will continue to communicate is it is absolutely essential that we have a system of legal immigration that allows people to come into this growing economy under the color of the law.\\nEND   \n",

CDT THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you.  Please, if you have a seat, sit down.  And I got to make one check here. (The President leaves the podium to greet audience members.) (The President returns to the podium.) I just had to make sure the two girls got ice cream when this is over.  (Laughter.)  Imagine how excited you’d be when you’re — four?  Five? AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Almost five. THE PRESIDENT:  Almost five years old, coming to hear a President speak.  (Laughter.)  My Lord.  In my faith, we call that purgatory.  (Laughter.)  Lauren, thank you for that gracious introduction.  And in case you were wondering, I — in Delaware — we’re a small state — we have the eighth-largest Black population in America, and we have one of the most talented members of Congress.  And so if I didn’t walk around and pay my tribute to Lisa Blunt Rochester my congresswoman — (applause) — immediately, that was — How are you, Rev?  Good to see you. We’ve got a distinguished group of people here, and I want to thank Lauren for sharing the powerful story and for helping the country understand what’s happening here. And to all of the descendants here today, and to the community and civil rights leaders, and members of the Congressional Black Caucus that are here: Thank you for making sure we all remember and we never forget. You know, there’s a verse in First Corinthians that says, “For now, we see in a mirror dimly, but then, face to face, now I know in part, then I shall know fully.” It is — I just toured the Hall of Survivors here in Greenwood Cultural Center, and I want to thank the incredible staff for hosting us here.  And — (applause) — I mean that sincerely.  Thank you. And if I didn’t say what my father would insist on, please excuse my back.  (Laughter.)  I apologize. But the tour — in the tour, I met Mother Randle, who’s only 56 [107] years old.  (Laughter.)  God love her.  And Mother Fletcher, who’s 67 [106] years old.  (Laughter.)  And her brother — her brother, Van Ellis, who’s 100 years old.  (Laughter.)  And he looks like he’s 60.  Thank you for spending so much time with me.  I really mean it.  It was a great honor.  A genuine honor. You are the three known remaining survivors of a story seen in the mirror dimly.  But no longer.  Now your story will be known in full view. The events we speak of today took place 100 years ago.  And yet, I’m the first President in 100 years ever to come to Tulsa — (applause) — I say that not as a compliment about me, but to think about it — a hundred years, and the first President to be here during that entire time, and in this place, in this ground, to acknowledge the truth of what took place here. For much too long, the history of what took place here was told in silence, cloaked in darkness.  But just because history is silent, it doesn’t mean that it did not take place.  And while darkness can hide much, it erases nothing.  It erases nothing.  Some injustices are so heinous, so horrific, so grievous they can’t be buried, no matter how hard people try. And so it is here.  Only — only with truth can come healing and justice and repair.  Only with truth, facing it.  But that isn’t enough.  First, we have to see, hear, and give respect to Mother Randle, Mother Fletcher, and Mr. Van Ellis.  (Applause.)  To all those lost so many years ago, to all the descendants of those who suffered, to this community — that’s why we’re here: to shine a light, to make sure America knows the story in full. May 1921: Formerly enslaved Black people and their descendants are here in Tulsa — a boom town of oil and opportunity in a new frontier. On the north side, across the rail tracks that divided the city already segregated by law, they built something of their own, worthy — worthy of their talent and their ambition: Greenwood — a community, a way of life.  Black doctors and lawyers, pastors, teachers; running hospitals, law practices, libraries, churches, schools. Black veterans, like a man I had the privilege to giving a Command Coin to, who fought — volunteered and fought, and came home and still faced such prejudice.  (Applause.)  Veterans had been back a few years helping after winning the first World War, building a new life back home with pride and confidence, who were a mom-and — they were, at the time — mom-and-plack [sic] — mom-and-pop Black diners, grocery stores, barber shops, tailors — the things that make up a community. At the Dreamland Theatre, a young Black couple, holding hands, falling in love.  Friends gathered at music clubs and pool halls; at the Monroe family roller-skating rink.  Visitors staying in hotels, like the Stradford. All around, Black pride shared by the professional class and the working class who lived together, side by side, for blocks on end. Mother Randle was just six years old — six years old — living with her grandmom.  She said she was lucky to have a home and toys, and fortunate to live without fear. Mother Fletcher was seven years old, the second of seven children.  The youngest, being Mr. Van Ellis, was just a few months old.  The children of former sharecroppers, when they went to bed at night in Greenwood, Mother Fletcher says they fell asleep rich in terms of the wealth — not real wealth, but a different wealth — a wealth in culture and community and heritage.  (Applause.)  But one night — one night changed everything.  Everything changed.  While Greenwood was a community to itself, it was not separated from the outside. It wasn’t everyone, but there was enough hate, resentment, and vengeance in the community.  Enough people who believed that America does not belong to everyone and not everyone is created equal — Native Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Black Americans.  A belief enforced by law, by badge, by hood and by noose.   And it speaks to that — lit the fuse.  It lit it by the spark that it provided — a fuse of fury — was an innocent interaction that turned into an in- — a terrible, terrible headline allegation of a Black male teenager attacking a white female teenager. A white mob of 1,000 gathered around the courthouse where the Black teenager was being held, ready to do what still occurred: lynch that young man that night.  But 75 Black men, including Black veterans, arrived to stand guard.  Words were exchanged.  Then a scuffle.  Then shots fired.  Hell was unleashed.  Literal hell was unleashed.  Through the night and into the morning, the mob terrorized Greenwood.  Torches and guns.  Shooting at will.  A mob tied a Black man by the waist to the back of their truck with his head banging along the pavement as they drove off.  A murdered Black family draped over the fence of their home outside.  An elderly couple, knelt by their bed, praying to God with their heart and their soul, when they were shot in the back of their heads. Private planes — private planes — dropping explosives — the first and only domestic aerial assault of its kind on an American city here in Tulsa. Eight of Greenwood’s nearly two dozen churches burned, like Mt. Zion — across the street, at Vernon AME. Mother Randle said it was like war.  Mother Fletcher says, all these years later, she still sees Black bodies around. The Greenwood newspaper publisher A.J. Smitherton [sic] — excuse me — Smitherman penned a poem of what he heard and felt that night.  And here’s the poem.  He said, “Kill them, burn them, set the pace… teach them how to keep their place.  Reign of murder, theft, and plunder was the order of the night.”  That’s what he remembered in the poem that he wrote. One hundred years ago at this hour, on this first day of June, smoke darkened the Tulsa sky, rising from 35 blocks of Greenwood that were left in ash and ember, razed and in rubble. Less than 24 hours — in less than 24 hours, 1,100 Black homes and businesses were lost.  Insurance companies — they had insurance, many of them — rejected claims of damage.  Ten thousand people were left destitute and homeless, placed in internment camps. As I was told today, they were told, “Don’t you mention you were ever in a camp or we’ll come and get you.”  That’s what survivors told me. Yet no one — no arrests of the mob were made.  None.  No proper accounting of the dead.  The death toll records by local officials said there were 36 people.  That’s all.  Thirty-six people. But based on studies, records, and accounts, the likelihood — the likely number is much more, in the multiple of hundreds. Untold bodies dumped into mass graves.  Families who, at the time, waited for hours and days to know the fate of their loved ones are now descendants who have gone 100 years without closure. But, you know, as we speak, the process — the process of exhuming the unmarked graves has started.  And at this moment, I’d like to pause for a moment of silence for the fathers, the mothers, the sisters, sons, and daughters, friends of God and Greenwood.  They deserve dignity, and they deserve our respect.  May their souls rest in peace. [Pause for a moment of silence.] My fellow Americans, this was not a riot.  This was a massacre — (applause) — among the worst in our history, but not the only one.  And for too long, forgotten by our history. As soon as it happened, there was a clear effort to erase it from our memory — our collective memories — from the news and everyday conversations.  For a long time, schools in Tulsa didn’t even teach it, let alone schools elsewhere. And most people didn’t realize that, a century ago, a second Ku Klux Klan had been founded — the second Ku Klux Klan had been founded. A friend of mine, Jon Meacham — I had written — when I said I was running to restore the soul of America, he wrote a book called “The Soul of America” — not because of what I said.  And there’s a picture about page 160 in his book, showing over 30,000 Ku Klux Klan members in full regalia, Reverend — pointed hats, the robes — marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C.  Jesse, you know all about this.  Washin- — Washington, D.C. If my memory is correct, there were 37 members of the House of Representatives who were open members of the Klan.  There were five, if I’m not mistaken — it could have been seven; I think it was five — members of the United States Senate — open members of the Klan.  Multiple governors who were open members of the Klan. Most people didn’t realize that, a century ago, the Klan was founded just six years before the horrific destruction here in Tulsa.  And one of the reasons why it was founded was because of guys like me, who were Catholic.  It wasn’t about African Americans, then; it was about making sure that all those Polish and Irish and Italian and Eastern European Catholics who came to the United States after World War One would not pollute Christianity. The flames from those burning crosses torched every region — region of the country.  Millions of white Americans belonged to the Klan, and they weren’t even embarrassed by it; they were proud of it. And that hate became embedded systematically and systemically in our laws and our culture.  We do ourselves no favors by pretending none of this ever happened or that it doesn’t impact us today, because it does still impact us today. We can’t just choose to learn what we want to know and not what we should know.  (Applause.)  We should know the good, the bad, everything.  That’s what great nations do: They come to terms with their dark sides.  And we’re a great nation. The only way to build a common ground is to truly repair and to rebuild.  I come here to help fill the silence, because in silence, wounds deepen.  (Applause.)  And only — as painful as it is, only in remembrance do wounds heal.  We just have to choose to remember. We memorialize what happened here in Tulsa so it can be –so it can’t be erased.  We know here, in this hallowed place, we simply can’t bury pain and trauma forever. And at some point, there will be a reckoning, an inflection point, like we’re facing right now as a nation. What many people hadn’t seen before or ha- — or simply refused to see cannot be ignored any longer.  You see it in so many places.  And there’s greater recognition that, for too long, we’ve allowed a narrowed, cramped view of the promise of this nation to fester — the view that America is a zero-sum game where there is only one winner.  “If you succeed, I fail.  If you get ahead, I fall behind.  If you get a job, I lose mine.”   And maybe worst of all, “If I hold you down, I lift myself up,” instead of “If you do well, we all do well.”  (Applause.)  We see that in Greenwood. This story isn’t about the loss of life, but a loss of living, of wealth and prosterity [prosperity] and possibilities that still reverberates today. Mother Fletcher talks about how she was only able to attend school until the fourth grade and eventually found work in the shipyards, as a domestic worker. Mr. Van Ellis has shared how, even after enlisting and serving in World War Two, he still came home to struggle with a segregated America. Imagine all those hotels and dinners [diners] and mom-and-pop shops that could been — have been passed down this past hundred years.  Imagine what could have been done for Black families in Greenwood: financial security and generational wealth. If you come from backgrounds like my — my family — a working-class, middle-class family — the only way we were ever able to generate any wealth was in equity in our homes.  Imagine what they contributed then and what they could’ve contributed all these years.  Imagine a thriving Greenwood in North Tulsa for the last hundred years, what that would’ve meant for all of Tulsa, including the white community. While the people of Greenwood rebuilt again in the years after the massacre, it didn’t last.  Eventually neighborhoods were redlined on maps, locking Black Tulsa out of homeownerships.  (Applause.)  A highway was built right through the heart of the community.  Lisa, I was talking about our west side — what 95 did to it after we were occupied by the military, after Dr. King was murdered.  The community — cutting off Black families and businesses from jobs and opportunity.  Chronic underinvestment from state and federal governments denied Greenwood even just a chance at rebuilding.  (Applause.) We must find the courage to change the things we know we can change.  That’s what Vice President Harris and I are focused on, along with our entire administration, including our Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Marcia Fudge, who is here today.  (Applause.) Because today, we’re announcing two expanded efforts targeted toward Black wealth creation that will also help the entire community.  The first is: My administration has launched an aggressive effort to combat racial discrimination in housing.  That includes everything from redlining to the cruel fact that a home owned by a Black family is too often appraised at a lower value than a similar home owned by a white family.  (Applause.) And I might add — and I need help if you have an answer to this; I can’t figure this one out, Congressman Horsford.  But if you live in a Black community and there’s another one on the other side of the highway — it’s a white community; it’s the — built by the same builder, and you have a better driving record than they guy with the same car in the white community, you’re — can pay more for your auto insurance.  Shockingly, the percentage of Black American homeownership is lower today in America than when the Fair Housing Act was passed more than 50 years ago.  Lower today.  That’s wrong.  And we’re committing to changing that. Just imagine if instead of denying millions of Americansthe ability to own their own home and build generational wealth, we made it possible for them to buy a home and build equity into that — into that home and provide for their families. Second, small businesses are the engines of our economy and the glue of our communities.  As President, my administration oversees hundreds of billions of dollars in federal contracts for everything from refurbishing decks of aircraft carriers, to installing railings in federal buildings, to professional services. We have a thing called — I won’t go into it all because there’s not enough time now.  But I’m determined to use every taxpayer’s dollar that is assigned to me to spend, going to American companies and American workers to build Ameri– to build American products.   And as part of that, I’m going to increase the share of the dollars the federal government spends to small, disadvantaged businesses, including Black and brown small businesses. Right now, it calls for 10 percent; I’m going to move that to 15 percent of every dollar spent will be spent (inaudible).  (Applause.)  I have the authority to do that.  Just imagine if, instead of denying millions of entrepreneurs the ability to access capital and contracting, we made it possible to take their dreams to the marketplace to create jobs and invest in our communities. That — the data shows young Black entrepreneurs are just as capable of succeeding, given the chance, as white entrepreneurs are.  But they don’t have lawyers.  They don’t have — they — they don’t have accountants, but they have great ideas.  Does anyone doubt this whole nation would be better off from the investments those people make?  And I promise you, that’s why I set up the — a national Small Business Administration that’s much broader.  Because they’re going to get those loans.   Instead of consigning millions of American children to under-resourced schools, let’s give each and every child, three and four years old, access to school — not daycare, school.  (Applause.) In the last 10 years, studies have been done by all the great universities.  It shows that, if increased by 56 percent, the possibility of a child — no matter what background they come from; no matter what — if they start school at three years old, they have a 56 percent chance of going all through all 12 years without any trouble and being able to do well, and a chance to learn and grow and thrive in a school and throughout their lives. And let’s unlock more than — an incredible creativity and innovation that will come from the nation’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  (Applause.)  I have a $5 billion program giving them the resources to invest in research centers and laboratories and high-demand fields to compete for the good-paying jobs in industries like — of the future, like cybersecurity. The reason why they don’t — their — their students are equally able to learn as well, and get the good-paying job that start at 90- and 100,000 bucks.  But they don’t have — they don’t have the back — they don’t have the money to provide and build those laboratories.  So, guess what?  They’re going to get the money to build those laboratories.  (Applause.)  So, instead of just talking about infrastructure, let’s get about the — about the business of actually rebuilding roads and highways, filling the sidewalks and cracks, installing streetlights and high-speed Internet, creating space — space to live and work and play safely. Let’s ensure access to healthcare, clean water, clean air, nearby grocery stores — stock the fresh vegetables and food that — (applause) — in fact, deal with — I mean, these are all things we can do. Does anyone doubt this whole nation would be better off with these investments?  The rich will be just as well off.  The middle class will do better, and everybody will do better.  It’s about good-paying jobs, financial stability, and being able to build some generational wealth.  It’s about economic growth for our country and outcompeting the rest of the world, which is now outcompeting us. But just as fundamental as any of these investments I’ve discussed — this may be the most fundamental: the right to vote.  (Applause.)  The right to vote.  (Applause.) A lot of the members of the Black Caucus knew John Lewis better than I did, but I knew him.  On his deathbed, like many, I called John, to speak to him.  But all John wanted to do was talk about how I was doing.  He died, I think, about 25 hours later. But you know what John said?  He called the right to vote “precious,” “almost sacred.”  He said, “The most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democratic society”. This sacred right is under assault with an incredible intensity like I’ve never seen — even though I got started as a public defender and a civil rights lawyer — with an intensity and an aggressiveness that we have not seen in a long, long time.  It’s simply un-American.  It is not, however, sadly, unprecedented.  The creed “We Shall Overcome” is a longtime mainstay of the Civil Rights Movement, as Jesse Jackson can tell you better than anybody. The obstacle to proc- — to progress that have to be overcome are a constant challenge.  We saw it in the ‘60s, but with the current assault, it’s not just an echo of a distant history.  In 2020, we faced a tireless assault on the right to vote: restrictive laws, lawsuits, threats of intimidation, voter purges, and more.  We resolved to overcome it all, and we did.  More Americans voted in the last election than any — in the midst of a pandemic — than any election in American history.  (Applause.)  You got voters registered.  You got voters to the polls.  The rule of law held.  Democracy prevailed.  We overcame.  But today, let me be unequivocal: I’ve been engaged in this work my whole career, and we’re going to be ramping up our efforts to overcome again.  I will have more to say about this at a later date — the truly unprecedented assault on our democracy, an effort to replace nonpartisan election administrators and to intimidate those charged with tallying and reporting the election results.  But today, as for the act of voting itself, I urge voting rights groups in this country to begin to redouble their efforts now to register and educate voters.  (Applause.)  And in June — June should be a month of action on Capitol Hill.  I hear all the folks on TV saying, “Why doesn’t Biden get this done?”  Well, because Biden only has a majority of, effectively, four votes in the House and a tie in the Senate, with two members of the Senate who vote more with my Republican friends.  But we’re not giving up.  Earlier this year, the House of Representatives passed For the People Act to protect our democracy.  The Senate will take it up later this month, and I’m going to fight like heck with every tool at my disposal for its passage. The House is also working on the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which is — which is critical — (applause) — to providing new legal tools to combat the new assault on the right to vote.  To signify the importance of our efforts, today I’m asking Vice President Harris to help these efforts and lead them, among her many other responsibilities.  With her leadership and your support, we’re going to overcome again, I promise you.  But it’s going to take a hell of a lot of work.  (Applause.) And finally, we have to — and finally, we must address what remains the stain on the soul of America.  What happened in Greenwood was an act of hate and domestic terrorism with a through line that exists today still.  Just close your eyes and remember what you saw in Charlottesville four years ago on television.  Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, the KKK coming out of those fields at night in Virginia with lighted torches — the veins bulging on their — as they were screaming.  Remember?  Just close your eyes and picture what it was. Well, Mother Fletcher said when she saw the insurrection at the Capitol on January the 9th [6th], it broke her heart — a mob of violent white extremists — thugs.  Said it reminded her what happened here in Greenwood 100 years ago. Look around at the various hate crimes against Asian Americans and Jewish Americans.  Hate that never goes away.  Hate only hides. Jesse, I think I mentioned this to you.  I thought, after you guys pushed through, with Dr. King, the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act — I thought we moved.  But what I didn’t realize — I thought we had made enormous progress, and I was so proud to be a little part of it.  But you know what, Rev?  I didn’t realize hate is never defeated; it only hides.  It hides.  And given a little bit of oxygen — just a little bit oxygen — by its leaders, it comes out of there from under the rock like it was happening again, as if it never went away.  And so, folks, we can’t — we must not give hate a safe harbor.  As I said in my address to the joint session of Congress: According to the intelligence community, terrorism from white supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeland today.  Not ISIS, not al Qaeda — white supremacists.  (Applause.)  That’s not me; that’s the intelligence community under both Trump and under my administration.  Two weeks ago, I signed into law the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which the House had passed and the Senate.  My administration will soon lay out our broader strategy to counter domestic terrorism and the violence driven by the most heinous hate crimes and other forms of vigorty [sic] — of bigotry.  But I’m going to close where I started.  To Mother Randle, Mother Fletcher, Mr. Van Ellis, to the descendants, and to all survivors: Thank you.  Thank you for giving me the honor of being able to spend some time with you earlier today.  Thank you for your courage.  Thank you for your commitment.  And thank your children, and your grandchildren, and your unc- — and your nieces and your nephews.  To see and learn from you is a gift — a genuine gift.  Dr. John Hope Franklin, one of America’s greatest historians — Tulsa’s proud son, whose father was a Greenwood survivor — said, and I quote, “Whatever you do, it must be done in the spirit of goodwill and mutual respect and even love.  How else can we overcome the past and be worthy of our forebearers and face the future with confidence and with hope?” On this sacred and solemn day, may we find that distinctly Greenwood spirit that defines the American spirit — the spirit that gives me so much confidence and hope for the future; that helps us see, face to face; a spirit that helps us know fully who we are and who we can be as a people and as a nation. I’ve never been more optimistic about the future than I am today.  I mean that.  And the reason is because of this new generation of young people.  They’re the best educated, they’re the least prejudiced, the most open generation in American history.  And although I have no scientific basis of what I’m about to say, but those of you who are over 50 — how often did you ever see — how often did you ever see advertisements on television with Black and white couples?  Not a joke.  I challenge you — find today, when you turn on the stations — sit on one station for two hours.  And I don’t know how many commercials you’ll see — eight to five — two to three out of five have mixed-race couples in them.  That’s not by accident.  They’re selling soap, man.  (Laughter.)  Not a joke.  Remember ol’ Pat Caddell?  He used to say, “You want to know what’s happening in American culture?  Watch advertising, because they want to sell what they have.”  We have hope in folks like you, honey.  I really mean it.  We have hope.  But we’ve got to give them support.  We have got to give them the backbone to do what we know has to be done.  Because I doubt whether any of you would be here if you didn’t care deeply about this.  You sure in the devil didn’t come to hear me speak.  (Laughter.)  But I really mean it.  I really mean it.  Let’s not give up, man.  Let’s not give up.  As the old saying goes, “Hope springs eternal.”  I know we’ve talked a lot about famous people, but I’m — my colleagues in the Senate used to kid me because I was always quoting Irish poets.  They think I did it because I’m Irish.  They think I did it because we Irish — we have a little chip on our shoulder.  A little bit, sometimes.  That’s not why I did it; I did it because they’re the best poets in the world.  (Laughter.)  You can smile, it’s okay.  It’s true.  There was a famous poet who wrote a poem called “The Cure at Troy” — Seamus Heaney.  And there is a stanza in it that I think is the definition of what I think should be our call today for young people.  It said, “History teaches us not to hope on this side of the grave, but then, once in a lifetime, the longed-for tidal wave of justice rises up, and hope and history rhyme.”  Let’s make it rhyme.  Thank you. 3:54 P.M.

      \\nRoosevelt Room\\n11:34 A.M. EDT\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Good morning. I ran for President to rebuild the backbone of the middle class — this country — that’s the backbone — to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out and for — make sure the economy was stronger than it was before the pandemic.\\nSince I came to office, that’s what we’ve done: historic vaccination efforts that saved lives, helped our economy recover from the lost jobs during the pandemic; 10 million jobs created — a record for any administration at this point in a presidency; 3.5 percent unemployment — 50-year low — a 50-year low; 700,000 — nearly 700,000 manufacturing jobs created with companies investing billions of dollars to build industries of the future here in America, proving — proving — that “Made in America” is no longer just a slogan.\\nWe’re rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports. We’re delivering clean water, high-speed Internet to every American.\\nAnd the price of gas at the pump is coming down. It’s down $1.20 since this summer, and just this week — last week, it’s fallen another 10 cents.\\nAnd today, we have further proof that we’re rebuilding the economy in a responsible way.\\nToday, my administration announced that this year the deficit fell by $1.4 trillion — the largest one-year drop in American history — $1.4 trillion decline in the deficit.\\nLet me repeat that: the largest-ever decline in the federal deficit.\\nLet me be clear: This record deficit reduction includes the cost of my student loan plan and everything else we’re paying for. The deficit is down $1.4 trillion this year, even after accounting for 30 years of debt relief paid in advance.\\nYou know, this — this follows last year’s drop of $350 billion in the deficit.\\nAnd because we’re making sure the largest corporations pay their ma- — their fair share; cracking down on billionaire tax cheats; and giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices in the future beginning — just getting underway, which lowers one of the biggest costs that government and families have to pay, we’ll reduce, because of that, the deficit another $250 billion over the next 10 years.\\nYou know, we’re going from a historically strong economic recovery to a steady and stable growth while reducing the deficit, building an economy where everyone does well, where the poor have a ladder up, the middle class does well, and the wealthy do very well. They’re not hurt by it.\\nAnd this is the economic vision I’ve had for America and the reason I ran — one of the reasons.\\nRepublicans in Congress have a very different vision.\\nNow, listen to me closely: Congressional Republicans love to call Democrats “big spenders,” and they always claim to be for less federal spending. But let’s look at the facts.\\nThe federal deficit went up every single year in the Trump administration, every single year he was President. It went up before the pandemic. It went up during the pandemic. It went up every single year on his watch, the Republican watch.\\nIn fact, in three years before COVID hit, the deficit ballooned by another $400 billion.\\nThey’re the facts.\\nAnd one big reason for that is Republicans voted for $2 trillion tax cut — a Trump tax cut — which overwhelmingly benefitted the wealthy and the biggest corporations. And that racked up the deficit sig- — significantly.\\nOn my watch, things have been different. The deficit has come down both years that I’ve been in office. And I just signed legislation that’s going to relu- — going to reduce it even more in the decades to come.\\nNow Republicans in Congress are doubling down on their commitment to explode the deficit again.\\nJust this week — it’s hard to make this stuff up. Just this week, Republican leaders said if they get their way, they’re going to extend the tax — the Trump tax cuts, which are due to expire in a couple years — extend them.\\nThey said they’ll repeal the corporate minimum tax of just 15 percent that I just signed into law — 15 percent.\\nThey’d allow the largest and most prosperous corporations in America to go back to paying zero in federal income tax, which 55 of them did in 2020.\\nThey said they’ll repeal the lower prescription drug costs and it will take effect next year, which that’s — and they don’t — these major reductions in drug costs don’t really kick in until next year.\\nIf the Republicans repeal it, it’s going to raise costs onto millions of seniors, and the cost of federal government — to the federal government will be billions of dollars.\\nPut it all together and the Republican plan would add about $3 trillion to the deficit — $3 trillion. That’s their plan. That’s what they did under my predecessor, and that’s what they intend to do again. Adding another $3 trillion to the deficit is reckless, it’s irresponsible, and it would make inflation worse.\\nFor Americans, the deficit could not be clearer. We don’t have to take their — my word for it, what they’re for. They’ve laid out a plan that — out — and they laid it out very clearly. Congressional Republicans say — and you all know this — their number-one priority is to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.\\nNow, here’s what that means:\\nIf they get their way, the power we just gave Medicare to begin to negotiate lower prescriptions drugs goes away. Gone.\\nIf they get their way, the $2,000 cap on prescription drug costs, which takes effect next year — maximum any senior would have to pay, no matter what their drug costs are, would be $2,000. It goes away. Gone.\\nThe $35-a-month cap on insulin, which takes effect next year for folks on Medicare — gone.\\nThe savings on healthcare premiums of $800 a year for millions of Americans under the Affordable Care Act — gone.\\nAnd of — and, of course, they’re still determined to refea- — repeal the Affordable Care Act, which means an end to the protections for tens of millions of people who cannot afford health insurance because they have a preexisting condition. Let’s remember that we’re talking about millions of people who will lose their health insurance because they do not have a way to get it because they have a preexisting condition. That’s gone as well.\\nAnd they’re doing everything they can to get gas pri- — we’re doing everything we can to keep gas prices down, and the Republicans are against it all. And it’s all part of the trickle-down mentality that says, “It doesn’t matter what’s happening on Main Street as long as Wall Street is feeling good.”\\nOne more thing. If you’re worried about the economy, you need to know this: The Republican leadership in Congress has made it clear they will crash the economy next year by threatening the full faith and credit of the United States for the first time in our history, putting the United States in default unless — unless we yield to their demand to cut Social Security and Medicare. You heard that one, right? You all heard them say that. That’s what they’re saying.\\nLet me be really clear: I will not yield. I will not cut Social Security. I will not cut Medicare, no matter how hard they work at it.\\nFolks, we know what the Republicans in Congress will do if they regain power. They’re telling us. They’re being straight up about it. They’re going to repeal lower prescription drug prices I just signed into law and raise drug prices.\\nThey’re going to cut Social Security and Medicare.\\nThey’ll pass massive tax cuts for the wealthy, make them permanent — which they’re not now — the individual tax cuts.\\nThey’ll threaten the very foundations of the American economy if we don’t meet their demands.\\nAnd they talk about inflation. Everything they proposed — are proposing will make inflation worse. Everything they’re proposing would make inflation worse.\\nLet me close with this: Over the last few years, we’ve faced some of the most difficult challenges in our history both at home and abroad, but we’re making real progress. We just have to keep going. I know we can.\\nFor everything we’ve been through, I’ve never been more optimistic about our — America’s future. We just have to remember who we are. We’re the United States of America, and there’s nothing beyond our capacity.\\nAnd we’re better positioned than any other country in the world to get through this difficult period. Inflation is worse all around the world.\\nSo keep the faith. Keep the faith.\\nAnd God bless you. And may God protect our troops.\\nAnd I want to say one more thing actually. You know, I know — and I don’t blame you — you want to ask me about the midterms. (Laughs.)\\nAnd here’s what I think: It’s been back and forth with them ahead, us ahead, them ahead. Back and forth. And the polls have been all over the place. I think that we’re going to see one more shift back to our side in the closing days.\\nAnd let me tell you why I think that. We’re starting to see some of the good news on the economy. Gas prices are down sharply in 46 of the 50 states because of what I’ve been doing. We’re moving in the right direction, and there’s more to come.\\nState unemployment today — state unemployment was all-time lows in 11 states, and 17 states have unemployment rates under 3 percent. The new deficit numbers: There’s a — it’s a record — a record decrease. It’s never happened before.\\nThe election is not a referendum, it’s a choice. It’s a choice. And the Republicans criticized my economic record, but look at what I’ve inherited and what I’ve done.\\nAnd look at what they’re offering. They want to double down on the Trump tax cuts for the wealthy, make them permanent because they’re going to expire in 2025. They want to send jobs overseas where big corporations can, in fact, pay lower wages, increase their profits. And these are tax cuts that give most benefits to billionaires and wealthy corporations.\\nAnd let’s get specific. They want to abolish the 15 percent — 15 percent; what a terrible thing to ask a corporation to pay — 15 percent tax that I insisted that those 55 corporations who made $40 billion and didn’t pay a red cent. They now — my God, they got to pay 15 percent.\\nIf Republicans get their way, the deficit is going to soar, the tax burden is going to fall on the middle class. And Republicans are working really hard.\\nThis is — this one comes — I have to admit: Every once in a while, they surprise me. They have three — not one, not two — three plans to cut Social Security benefits. Three plans. And they’re not going to stop there.They’re going to do Big Pharma’s bidding to repeal my plan to allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drugs prices. And we pay the highest in the world. And doing so, it’s going to raise drug prices, and they’re going to raise Big Pharma’s profits. They’re doing fine, Big Pharma. They’re not hurting at all. And they’re going to raise your health insurance premiums.\\nIts mega MAGA trickle-down. Mega MAGA trickle-down — the kind of policies that have failed the country before and will fail it again. It’ll mean more wealth to the very wealthy, higher inflation for the middle class. That’s the choice we’re facing. That’s why I think that we’re going to do just fine.\\nThank you.\\nQ Mr. President, on the debt — on the debt ceiling.\\nQ Mr. President, speaking of midterms —\\nQ On the debt ceiling, do you support the permanent repeal of the debt ceiling, sir?\\nTHE PRESIDENT: The permanent repeal of the debt ceiling? What do you mean?\\nQ Of the debt limit. Yeah.\\nTHE PRESIDENT: You mean, just say we don’t have a debt limit?\\nQ No debt limit.\\nTHE PRESIDENT: No.\\nQ Okay.\\nTHE PRESIDENT: That would be irresponsible.\\nQ On Ukraine, sir. We — we have the — you have the —\\nQ Speaking of midterms, last night you said —\\nQ — means and the will to continue supporting Ukraine?\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Wait, wait, he — let’s get one at a time. Okay?\\nQ Thank you, sir. So, you heard the Republicans. You have the means and the will to continue supporting Ukraine?\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes, because if we support Ukraine, we’re supporting all of Europe, we’re supporting NATO. Do you think that Mr. Putin decides he’s just going to deal with Ukraine and that’s the end of it? This — no. I — I don’t understand the threat that they’re saying they may have to stop funding the Ukrainians in their — in their war against this brutal dictator.\\nYes. Last one.\\nQ On the midterms, sir. Last night, you said you need 53, not 51, votes to pass your agenda.\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I’m just getting greedy.\\nQ What did you mean by that? Were you referring to Manchin and Sinema?\\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I just think the more we have, the more certain. Fifty-one just gives me one more. I’d like to have three more. It’d make it a lot easier.\\nThank you very much.\\n11:47 A.M. EDT   \n",



                                                                                                              \\n2:44 P.M. CDT THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you, Amy.  What Fritz is really saying looking down is, “Joe, hide your Irish Catholic enthusiasm a little bit and be more Norwegian.”  (Laughter.)  A generous introduction.  You know, we got a chance to talk with the family a little bit earlier and trying to console them, and I got emotional.  But as my Grandfather Finnegan would say, “That’s the Irish of it.” You know, I served with Fritz a long time.  He became a good and close friend.  I was a kid when I got elected.  I wasn’t even old to be sworn in.  I was only 29 years old.  And because everything is based on seniority in the Senate, I got to hang out with folks like Fritz and Hubert long before you’d ordinarily at my age — because by the time I was there a second term, I was chairman of some major committees.  And so, I’m going to talk more today about Fritz and what he pretend didn’t exist but Fritz’s — Fritz’s sense of empathy.  Fritz had a special way about him that I don’t think he would talk about.  I could be wrong, but I never heard him talk about it.  You know, there was a question that Fritz famously asked staffers who came to work for him.  He’d say, “On the breakfast plate, what’s the difference between the eggs and the bacon?”  Senator Smith and Klobuchar know the answer.  (Laughter.) By supplying the eggs, the chicken made a contribution.  The hog was fully committed.  (Laughter and applause.) And it always surprised Fritz I knew a little about agriculture.  Delaware, my state, has a — and the Delmarva Peninsula has a $5 billion industry: chickens.  A lot of chickens.  A hell of a lot more chickens than people.  And it’s the biggest industry.  But Fritz was always committed not merely to the work of his lifetime, which all of you are familiar with.  Most people know, most of all, everybody was blessed to know him in this state. You know, Reverend Hart-Andersen, members of Congress and our military, distinguished guests; most of all, the Mondale family — Ted and William, and Rebecca and Chan; all the grandchildren — Louis, Amanda, Berit, Charlotte, Cassandra, Danielle; and all the dear friends of the family that are here as well, because he always talked about you all as family: I’m — I’m moved to be with you here today as an — honor one of the great giants in American history.  And that’s not hyperbole.  Fritz was a giant in American political history.  You know, a great American who — but he also had a lot of great Americans write about him and write things that related to him without them even knowing it. The great American novelist Edith Wharton wrote, “There are two ways of spreading light: to be a candle or the mirror that reflects it.”  Fritz was both the candle and the mirror, in my view — a candle spreading light and the mirror reflecting it. And today, I speak of a friend of five decades, about that light — the light of friendship and what it meant to me personally, to my family. Fritz and I first met in one of the darkest moments of my life.  I had not intended to run for the United States Senate.  I was involved — my state, it was a great shame, was segregated by law.  We have the eighth-largest Black population in America as a percent of population in Delaware.  I got involved in politics indirectly by getting involved in the Civil Rights Movement as a kid, being the only white employee in east side of Wilmington, an area called “The Bucket,” for years.  And I was asked by a group of senior Democrats would I — I was a young lawyer when I came back from law school.  And we were the only city in America occupied by the National Guard for 10 months, with every corner being occupied by National Guard members with a drawn bayonet because of Dr. King’s assassination and the riots that took place in my home state. And I had a job with one of the oldest law firms in the state — a “white shoe,” as they used to call the law firm.  And after being home for six months, I couldn’t do it anymore.  And I left and tried to — sought a job as a public defender to represent the people I used to work with in the — as a kid in high school and college.  And so, I came to the United States Senate with a passion to do something about civil rights.  And when I was elected, I ran initially for the group — with a group I joined, a group of senior members of the United States of the Delaware Democratic establishment to reform the Democratic Party, because we were more a southern Democratic Party than a northeastern Democratic Party.  You used to be able to be joined — the Southern Governors’ Conference with the Mid-Atlantic Conference.  And Democratic governors joined the Southern Governors’ Conference. But I couldn’t bring myself to be a Republican, even though they were more progressive because of Richard Nixon when I registered.  But I was asked to head up a committee of younger people to try to get someone to run for the United States Senate against a guy who was a decent guy, actually.  A little too conservative, but a decent guy.  And one thing led to another, and I ended up being asked to run for the Senate.  I had no intention of running for the Senate. But two years earlier, I had been elected to the county council.  And Delaware is like a miniature Illinois.  One county is 60 percent of the state’s population.  So, the councilperson — I represented a district seven times as large as a state representative and three times as large as a state senator.  And I ran and won.  I ran only to be a good soldier to try to get out Democrats voting.  And I wasn’t supposed to win.  The only reason I ran — I was certain I wasn’t going to rin [sic] — win — because I didn’t want to be a county councilman.  (Laughter.)  I wanted — I was just setting up a law firm as a young senator — as a young man, I should say. And so, what happened was I won in a district that was like 55, 56 percent Republican.  No Democrat had ever won.  Republicans saw something in me I didn’t see: They saw someone who may want to go on and run for office beyond that, so they reapportioned me from a four-year term to a two-year term (inaudible) 65 percent district.  And I was put in a position of up or out.  And a group of senior members — a former governor, a former United States Senator, a former congressman, and the chief justice of the — retired chief justice of the Supreme Court, whose family had more senators than any family in American history.  And they came to me — an off-year convention. I’ll never forget I was — how classic it was.  I was — there was a break in the convention in Dover, Delaware.  I was at a little motel nearby.  Had to — to go back and change with the younger people I was with.  And I had my own room.  And, you know, the typical kind of — you drive up to the front door, two headboards nailed on the wall, a desk nailed to the other wall, and an 8 by 10 bathroom. So I was in, shaving.  I had my towel around.  Man, I just got a shower and shaving, and I — there’s banging at the door. And I thought it was one of those — a guy named Bob Cunningham was with me.  I said, “All right, all right, all right.”  I went to the door and opened the door.  There was a former two-term governor named Elbert –- Elbert Carvel, a former congressman named Harrison, and the state chairman, and a former chief justice.  And I’m standing in a towel, shaving, and my — (laughter) — and the rest of me stark naked.  And I said — they said, “We want to talk to you, Joe.”  So I said, “Well, come in, gentlemen.”  I ran into the bathroom, take off the shaving cream, hoping I can find something to put on.  I had nothing to put on.  (Laughter.) So I came back out and I leaned against that desk and with a towel around me.  I said, “Yes, gentlemen?”  (Laughter.)  And they said, “Joe, we just had dinner.  We think you should run for the Senate.”  And I said, “But…”  And the chief justice — former Chief Justice (inaudible) said that.  I said, “Sir.”  I said, “I’m — I’m not old enough.”  He said, “Joe, you obviously didn’t do very well on constitutional law.”  (Laughter.)  I’m thinking, “Holy God, what did I do now?”  (Laughter.)  And he said, “You only have to be 30 to be sworn in.  They can elect you whenever you want.  You’ll be 30 seventeen days later. Well, I ran, and, to the shock and surprise of everybody, I won by a staggering 3,100 votes.  But here’s the point: I showed up on December 18th to hire staff.  I hadn’t been sworn in yet.  And what happened was that I had gotten a phone call that day from my fire department in Delaware.  And they put a poor young woman on the phone who said, “You got to come home.  There’s been an accident.”  And she went on to tell me — the poor kid had to tell me there was an accident.  I asked, “What happened?”  She said, “Your wife and daughter are dead, and your two boys may not make it.”  And, you know, the last thing I wanted to do was go to the United States Senate after that.  We had elected a governor — a Democrat.  He could appoint a Democrat.  And I had my brother talking to him about who we’d appoint.  But there was Fritz and Joan.  They embraced me, cont- — contacted me.  And it’s not just being nice, but bringing me in.  They came to the hospital to see my boys.  They helped me find my purpose in a sea of darkness and pain. And along — I was with Fritz, along with Mike Mansfield and Teddy Kennedy and a few others who all came to see me and said, “Just come six months.  You can go home after that.  We need you.”  We had 58 Democrats; they didn’t need me for a damn thing.  (Laughter.)  No, I’m serious.  But I was so — such a rookie I thought, “Maybe they need me to organize.”  (Laughter.) And they said, “Then you can leave.”  And I used to show up every Tuesday at three o’clock in the Senate chamber to get an assignment from Senator Mansfield.  Many times, Fritz would walk me over.  And I thought all freshmen got assignments.  I didn’t know that nobody gets an assignment in the Senate.  (Laughter.)  It wasn’t until about five months or three months in that I realized that was the case.  But they kept me engaged.  They helped me get up when it was easy to give up. My life changed again five years later.  No man deserves one great love in his life, let alone two, but I met and married Jill Biden.  I had to ask her five times.  (Laughter.)  True.  But being a spouse of a Senator who was relatively well known, because of the celebrity of how I got there and the accident, and inheriting two beautiful young boys wasn’t easy.  Once again, Fritz and Joan were there — were there spreading the light.  Joan was one of the first people to reach out to Jill, and it meant the world to us.  It meant the world.  You just heard from my friend, Jon Meacham, Fritz was a master legislator who shone a light on those who needed it most.  The desire to lift up others stemmed from his youth, from his service as a corporal in the U.S. Army, and those early days organizing for Hubert Humphrey in parts of Minnesota that Democrats didn’t win. Fritz learned early the power of bringing people together.  And I know that Fritz — for Fritz, no moment was brighter than when he joined forces — because I was with him; I was just a bit player — with an African American senator from — Massachusetts Senator Edward Brooke and they passed the Fair Housing Act. I was on the same side — the same side of the chamber in the back where Fritz was.  I remember the look on his face — literally remember the look on his face.  Opened up neighborhoods diminished by segregation for so long.  When the act passed, Fritz spoke on the Senate floor.  And he said that, quote, “The words ‘justice’ and ‘fairness’ will mean more to millions of our fellow Americans than they do — will never — meant more to our fellow Americans than they do today.” That was Fritz spreading light, the light of our country, to families who had never truly known its warmth. At every stage of our lives, at every inflection point, Fritz and Joan — I apologize, as we say in the Senate, for the, you know, point of personal privilege here — but they were there for Jill and me and my family — not on a political level, but on a personal level.  It was true that my — first days in the Senate when I needed help very badly, and it was true in my last days in the Senate as well. In 2008 — and Fritz and I had become close friends, and I sought his counsel many times — I was asked to join the ticket with Barack Obama. I was, as I usually was, on Amtrak going home.  I commuted every day.  They later told me over 1,200,000 miles on Amtrak.  They should name a station or something after me.  (Laughter.) But all kidding aside, he called me after it was clear he was the de facto nominee.  And he said he’d liked me to join him on the ticket, at least consider it; could he do a background check on me.  You know, we have to do that background check.  And I said, “No thanks, Barack.”  I thought he was just dragging that bloody (inaudible) through the Senate like president — presidential nominees do to get everybody excited and involved.  And Barack told me, “No, no, no, there’s only one other person I’m considering.”  I said, “Barack, I don’t want to be Vice President.”  He said, “Why?”  I said, “Because you’re basically just standby equipment.”  (Laughter.)  I said, “What I want to do — I’m — I’m…”  And by that time, I had chaired two major committees.  I was fairly influential in the Senate.  I said, “I can help you a lot more as a senator.  I’ll do everything I can.  I’ll campaign throughout the country for you.”  Barack to- — asked me — he said, “Look, would you go home and talk it over with your family?  Just talk it over.”  So I did.  I called Jill from the train on my cell phone. And when I got home — I was about halfway home when I had gotten the call.  And when I got home, I went in.  And the first person I called was Fritz before the family gathered in the back porch.  And I asked — I said, “Fritz, what should I do?”  And he went into great detail.  (Laughter.)  I’m serious.  As a matter of fact, he sent me a long memorandum he prepared for President Carter when they were deciding how the relationship would work.  He told me, in essence, that the vice presidency holds no inherent power.  None.  Zero.  The Vice President is merely — and it’s true — a reflection of your relationship with the President of the United States. About seven years ago, I joined Fritz at a forum in his honor at George Washington University.  Fritz recounted that his greatest strength wasn’t his expertise in a particular policy area; it was the genuine personal relationship he built with President Jimmy Carter — a relationship built on real affection and trust. They sat down for lunch together every week.  Fritz said, “Make sure you get a commitment from Barack: Once a week, you have lunch to discuss whatever is on either of your minds.”  He was the first Vice President to have an office in the West Wing, just a few steps away from the Oval Office.  That never happened before.  They were over in the Executive Office Building across the street.  That was the true strength of the vice presidency he said, a strength that Barack and I replicated in our time in office and what I’m — Kamala and I are doing today.  And she sends her regards to the whole family.  She called me before I got in the plane.   It was Fritz who lit the way.  His core — at his core, Fritz embraced everybody with a belief that everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity — everybody.  Dignity.  Not just the right to vote, dignity.  He was loved by the American people because he reflected the goodness of the American people, especially the people of Minnesota. You know, every senator wears on his or her sleeve the state they serve.  But the love Fritz had for the people of Minnesota ran deeper than that.  He loved you all, and you loved him back — it was obvious — because Fritz reflected the very best qualities of this state: the warmth and optimism that you reflect. At every turn, Fritz reflected the light of this nation, who we are and what we can be.  He called me when I had said in the inauguration that we’re the most unique nation in all of history.  We’re the only nation founded on an idea.  Every other nation in the world is based on geography, ethnicity, religion, race.  We’re founded on an idea.  “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, including the right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.”  And it goes on. Fritz believed that in his gut.  I watched him every day for over 35 years in the Senate and when he was Vice President.  He united people, sharing the same light, the same hopes.  Even when we disagree, he thought that was important.  I’ll never forget, on a personal level, what it meant to have a friend like Fritz.  Less than four years after losing Eleanor to brain cancer and just a year after losing Joan, Fritz was there to help me again when Jill and I lost our son Beau to brain cancer after a year in Iraq. I’ll never forget how Fritz reflected so much love and light into our family — again, at our darkest moments — nor will I forget coming here to Minneapolis eight years ago to say goodbye to Joan.  Most of you remember that Fritz went to the Mayo Clinic for quadruple bypass the very next day.  He had delayed the surgery so he could be with all of us to reflect her light.  And he put off treating his own heart because, as all you know, his heart belonged to Joan.  As I’ve said many times — I say to the family, seeing your mom and dad together reminded me of that great line from Christopher Marlowe’s poem: “Come live with me and be my love, and we shall all the pleasures prove.” You can tell when a couple has been together a long time.  So looks at each other with love — deep love.    It’s been said that memory is the power to gather roses in winter.  Well, Ted and William, your dad blessed you with an endless garden of those memories and, most of all, the memory of two extraordinary loves: a love of more than 58 years he spent together with your mom, and a love of 51 years with your sister, Eleanor. In his farewell letter, Fritz wrote that he was eager to rejoin Joan and Eleanor, two unbreakable loves.  You know, Jill Biden wanted to do a garden at the Vice President’s Residence — a picture of which shows on the screen outside here that I’m standing in front of the Residence — so that every family that ever had lived there, there was a garden with stones and engraving on each of the stones with the name of the — the couple and the children.  When I called Fritz to tell him about it, he came over to the house.  And it was a summer day.  And he wanted — he said, “Can we go in the house?”  I said, “Of course.”  He wanted to walk up to the third floor.  He walked up to the third floor and then, to the end, there are bedrooms in the third floor.  And he stopped in front of a door and opened it and just stared.  And I knew he was thinking something deep, and I went down the hallway.  And a few minutes — a few minutes went by and he came down.  And he said, “That was Eleanor’s room.  I so miss her.”  Well, they’re all together now, for all time.  Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, “An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man.” There is no doubt that the institution of the Senate and the institution — the institution of the Vice President reflect the profound legacy of Fritz Mondale. But it’s not a lengthened shadow we see in those places; it’s his light.  And it’s up to each of us now to reflect that light that Fritz was all about, to reflect Fritz’s goodness and grace, the way he made people feel no matter who you were. Just imagine what our nation could achieve if we followed Fritz’s example of honor, decency, integrity, literally just the service to the common good.  There would be nothing — nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our reach. I hope we all can be Fritz’s mirror, continue to spread his light.  Because you know he was one of the finest men you’ve ever known, one of the most decent people I ever dealt with, and one of the toughest, smartest men I’ve ever worked with.   You were lucky to have had him.  (Inaudible) look at things, he was lucky to have had you.  God bless you, my dear friend.  Among the greatest of all Americans.  The highest compliment, my Grandfather Finnegan used to say, you can give a man or a woman — he was — the Irish of it is to say, “He’s a good man.”  Fritz Mondale was a good man.  (Applause.)   3:12 P.M.

                                                     \\nLa Nuvola\\nRome, Italy\\n5:28 P.M. CET\\nPRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you all for joining us today.  I think the Prime Minister may be still occupied in another part of the building, so we’re going to begin.\\nWe’re going to bring our shared attention to a vital issue that is impacting on all of our countries: supply chain disruptions.  Supply chains are something that most of our citizens never think twice about until something goes wrong.\\nAnd during this pandemic, we’ve seen delays and backlogs of goods — from automobiles to electronics, from shoes to furniture.\\nEnding the pandemic is the ultimate key to unlocking the disruptions we’re all contending with.  But we have to take action now, together with our partners in the private sector, to reduce the backlogs that we’re facing.  And then, we have to prevent this from happening again in the future.\\nNow that we have seen how vulnerable these lines of global commerce can be, we cannot go back to business as usual.  This pandemic won’t be the last global health crisis we face.  We also need to increase our resilience in the face of climate change, natural disasters, and even planned attacks.\\nMany of our supply chains are almost entirely owned and operated by the private sector.  But government can play a key role identifying supply chain risks and bringing the different pieces and actors together to address these vulnerabilities.\\nIn the United States, my administration has focused on this from our earliest days of the administration, which is not that long ago — just January 20th of this year.  In February, we began directing new investments to strengthen supply chains at home and to work with partners to bolster supply chains around the world.\\nLast month, we launched an early warning system to help get ahead of the global supply chain disruptions from — for computer chips, which impacts so many industries in my country and all of yours.\\nJust a few weeks ago, we were able to facilitate an agreement with key unions, retailers, and freight movers to begin operating two of the largest ports in the United States that account for 40 percent of the imports on the West Coast: the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach, California.  So, we got them to move from 5 days a week, 8 hours a day, to 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.\\nI’m going to help get — it’s going to help get goods on the shelves faster.  And our Build Back Better framework provides, for the first time, funding dedicated to monitoring and strengthening supply chains.\\nToday, I’m announcing two further steps: First, I’m allocating additional funding to help American partners, as well as the United States, cut port congestion by slashing red tape and reducing processing times so that ships can get in and out of our ports faster.\\nAnd second, I’m signing an executive order that will strengthen our management of the United States defense stockpiles for minerals and materials.  It’ll allow us — allow us to react and respond more quickly to shortfalls in the industrial base.\\nI urge all of you — all of you — to consider bolstering your stockpiles critical to national security in your countries.  But like so many challenges today, it isn’t a problem any one of our nations can solve through unilateral actions.  Coordination is the key — the reason for this meeting.\\nThe best way to reduce current delays and build in greater resilience for the future is to work together across the entire supply chain, from raw materials to warehousing and distribution.\\nOur supply chain should be: one, diversified, so that we’re not dependent on any one single source that might cause a failure; secure — secure against natural and manmade threats, including cyber and criminal attacks, like ransomware; and transparent so that both government and the private sector can better anticipate and respond to shortages that may be coming down the pike; and sustainable, to ensure our supply chains are free from forced and child labor, supporting the dignity and the voice of workers and are in line with our climate goals.\\nBecause at the end of the day, supply chain resilience is really about all of our people, the workers around the world who make the flow of goods possible — factory workers, dockworkers, welders, shipping crews, truckers, childcare providers, locomotives, so many other pieces.\\nSolving this is going to take all of us — government and private industry, labor unions and research institutions.\\nSo, I’m directing my Secretary of State — Secretaries of State and Commerce to chair a multi-stakeholder forum in the beginning of next year to bring all these key parties together with relevant officials from all of our governments to chart a path forward.\\nI look forward to hearing from each of you and finding ways we can work together to increase our resilience and enhance our shared prosperity.\\nNow I’m going to turn it over to Secretary Blinken to actually make sure the trains run on time here.\\n5:36 P.M.
