As a parent of four children, I find it imperative that we get back to school as safely as possible.\nJoe Biden: One, first of all, making sure everybody is wearing protective gear. It's available to students as well as to teachers, the janitors, the people who work in the cafeteria, the bus drivers. Secondly, organizing in smaller pods, which means that's why we need more teachers. Instead of a classroom of 30 kids in it, you have three classes in that same of 10 kids each in those, I'm making the number up, less, doesn't have to be literally 10. In addition to that, we also have indicated that it is much better, it's much easier to send kids K through eight back because they are less likely to communicate the disease to somebody else.\n",

We've got to make sure that you don't have 60 kids or however many, it would depend on the size of the school bus, sitting two abreast in every single seat."
